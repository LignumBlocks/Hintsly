But memory foam is offered in different densities, designs and feels—so there are several other mattresses on this list worthy of consideration. In fact, many of our memory foam favorites are also featured in our guide to the best mattresses of 2024. Whether you enjoy a sinking, slow-moving mattress or a more responsive foam bed, we’ve tracked down the best options that strike the right balance of quality, comfort and affordability. If you love sink-in comfort, you may want to pick up a memory foam pillow while you’re at it.

Brand firmness rating: Medium-firm (6.5) | Type: Gel memory foam | Height: 13 inches | CertiPUR-US certified: Yes | Trial: 365 nights | Warranty: Lifetime

Pros:

Affordable; less than $1,000 for a queen 
Made with a temperature-regulating cover
Generous trial period and warranty

Cons:

Stomach sleepers may want a firmer option

Nectar recently released a lineup of new mattress models, and the new Nectar Premier has some characteristics that, in my opinion, make it even better than its predecessor. I traditionally don’t love memory foam mattresses because they push back against my body when I try and switch positions, but the Nectar Premier is different. During my testing at the Nectar facility, I found that the new model is soft and marshmallowy, and a bit more responsive to pressure than the previous Nectar Premier model. It also offers top-notch motion isolation to help deaden movement across the mattress.

Although memory foam is great at absorbing motion, it’s also known to absorb heat (and retain it). The Nectar Premier helps fight that stereotype with a cover that’s woven with cooling fibers—over 60% more fibers than the Nectar Classic (the brand’s entry-level model). Underneath the hood is the NectarTech System, which consists of a contouring memory foam layer and responsive transition layer for a signature memory foam feel that doesn’t make you feel like you’re being engulfed in the foam’s layers. Instead, it’s more responsive and provides a more lifted feel than the old model. 

Expert tip: If you weigh over 250 pounds, we recommend you consider the more supportive Nectar Premier Hybrid Mattress, which has a pocketed steel coil base that is sturdier and more durable than an all-foam support layer. The Nectar Premier Hybrid can hold up to 1,000 pounds (500 pounds on each side), according to the brand.

SAVE $200.00 (9%)
Shop At Tempur-Pedic

Brand firmness rating: Medium (5 to 6) | Type: Memory foam | Height: 11 inches | CertiPUR-US certified: Yes | Trial: 90 nights | Warranty: 10 years

Pros:

Great pressure relief and motion isolation
Cool-to-the-touch cover
Ideal for fans of slow-moving memory foam

Cons:

Shorter trial period and warranty than some other brands

Tempur-Pedic is a well-established brand in the sleep industry, having honed its comfort layer technology through years of experience. This expertise is evident in the quality construction, glowing reviews and premium pricing of its mattresses. The Tempur-Adapt collection consists of three mattress models that are all offered in different configurations, but the most affordable is the entry-level Tempur-Adapt, which features a knit cover that’s cool to the touch plus two panels of NASA-developed Tempur-Material. The Tempur-Adapt is one of my favorites from the brand because of the bed’s value compared to Tempur-Pedic’s pricier options. 

It has that traditional, dense memory foam feel that people have come to love, with effective temperature-regulating capabilities to keep you sleeping cooler than you would on typical memory foam. During testing, our team member who sleeps hot claimed it slept cooler than her prior mattress, and she was no longer waking up in a sweat. 

The first comfort layer of this 11-inch mattress is designed to provide a comfortable feel, while the second slab (which sits beneath) provides support and adapts to your pressure points for “personalized comfort.” Along with stellar pressure relief, it tested really well for motion isolation, which is a great perk for couples who don’t want to be bothered by each other’s movements. While the brand rates the bed’s firmness a medium, we think it falls around a medium-firm. See more in our full Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt mattress review. 
Expert tip: A hybrid version with springs is also available if you’d like more bounce.

WinkBeds The GravityLux (Queen)
$1,499
$1,799
SAVE $300 (17%)
Shop At WinkBeds

Brand firmness rating: Soft (4), medium (5) or firm (7) | Type: Non-visco memory foam | Height: 13.5 inches | CertiPUR-US certified: Yes | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Lifetime

Pros:

Comes in three firmness levels
Excels at motion isolation; good for couples
More breathable than traditional memory foam

Cons:

Edge support somewhat lacking

If the sound of sinking into a cushioning, cradling bed at the end of a long day sounds appealing, then getting your hands on a handmade-to-order soft memory foam mattress like the GravityLux might be the right move. The WinkBeds GravityLux is a quality memory foam mattress with a plush, cushy feel that cradles your curves, but it responds more quickly to movement than beds from brands like Nectar or Tempur-Pedic (a plus for combination sleepers). Our testing found it’s also great at isolating motion, thanks to its all-foam design, and it doesn’t sleep as hot as your average memory foam bed.

This mattress stays cool with AirCell Memory Foam and temperature management unique to each individual sleeper. And yes, you can still enjoy the soft feeling of memory foam while receiving support; this six-layer model is designed to contour to the shoulders, legs and midsection for optimal comfort. It also has a zoned construction within the AirCell Memory Foam layer for targeted pressure relief and support where you need it. 
Expert tip: Side sleepers should opt for the medium or soft model, while back and stomach sleepers should consider the firm model.

SAVE $380.00 (35%)
Shop At Cocoon

Brand firmness rating: Medium-firm (6) | Type: Memory foam | Height: 10 inches | CertiPUR-US certified: Yes | Trial: 100 nights | Warranty: 10 years

Pros:

Helps cool down hot sleepers
Ideal for back, stomach and combination sleepers

Cons:

Not a good fit for most side sleepers

The Cocoon Chill Memory Foam Mattress is one of the best mattresses you can get for the money, especially if you’re a hot sleeper and fan of a traditional memory foam feel. While testing, I found it takes a second for the foam to warm up to your body, but once it does, it contours under your curves. It has an actively cooling cover with phase-change material that, in my testing experience, feels cool to the touch, plus breathable memory foam and a 10-inch profile. For a bed with these kinds of features, it’s typical to pay around $1,200 or more, but the Cocoon Chill usually goes for $700 with regular discounts. Its firmness falls around a medium-firm on the spectrum, so you sit more on top of the mattress than inside its comfort layers. As a result, it’s a good choice for hot sleepers and most sleeping positions—except for side sleepers, who need a more cushy firmness level. For those who want a little added support, you can upgrade to the Cocoon Chill Hybrid model, which has the same features, only it’s constructed with a pocketed coil base layer. 

Expert tip: The hybrid model has a similar cooling memory foam feel, but it is more supportive for sleepers who weigh over 250 pounds.

Shop At Amazon

Brand firmness rating: Medium (5 to 7) | Type: Gel memory foam | Height: 13 inches | CertiPUR-US certified: Yes | Trial: 101 nights | Warranty: 25 years

Pros:

Multiple cooling layers for a chill sleep experience
Accommodates side, back and combination sleepers

Cons:

May be a little soft for strict stomach sleepers

Several of the mattresses on our best memory foam mattresses list feature cooling tech, but the GhostBed Luxe takes it up another notch with multiple layers of cooling materials within its construction that actively work to cool you down at night. There’s “Ghost Ice” fabric in the cover for a cool-to-the-touch feel, and woven into the cover is a 1-inch layer of gel memory foam and 0.5 inch of cooling fiber. The Ghost Ice fabric is some of the coolest tech we’ve ever tried (it even works through bedding). 

Yet another Ghost Ice layer sits underneath the cover, which is followed by a gel memory foam layer for comfort and added temp regulation, then a transition layer that mimics latex foam (it’s the brand’s own proprietary type). If heat has you lying awake at night, the GhostBed Luxe may be a good solution. We found it offers a medium feel that works well for back and side sleepers. And our testing showed it’s a bit more responsive than a typical memory foam mattress, so you shouldn’t feel stuck in the foam layers.

Expert tip: Although the cooling fibers can be felt through bedding, we recommend you use breathable sheets to fully reap the bed’s benefits.

PLANK

Shop At Plank

Brand firmness rating: Firm (8) and extra-firm (10) | Type: Memory foam | Height: 9 inches | CertiPUR-US certified: Yes | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: 10 years

Pros:

Very supportive
A queen size is often on sale for around $1,000
Comes with two different firmness levels

Cons:

Not good for side sleepers

Brooklyn Bedding is behind the Plank Firm mattress, which is designed to be firm and supportive. It’s one of the firmest mattresses we’ve ever tested, and despite being an all-foam bed, it offers ample support for stomach sleepers and many back sleepers who prefer a firm feel.
The Plank Firm is 9 inches thick, with four memory foam layers and a flippable design. One side of the bed is considered firm, and the other is extra-firm. This allows sleepers to choose the support and firmness level that works best for them by turning the mattress over to the other side. While either side excels at providing spine alignment for stomach sleepers, heavyweight sleepers should opt for the extra-firm side, since they tend to sink into the mattress more. The Plank Firm also features a quilted top and bottom, and if you sleep hot, you can add a cooling cover for about $100 extra.
Expert tip: We think most back and stomach sleepers will like the firm side of the mattress, but the extra-firm side is an option for heavier stomach sleepers close to 250 pounds.

Pros:

Free white-glove delivery
Generous warranty and trial
Two firmness options available

Cons:

Relaxed-firm model leans toward the firm side of the spectrum and may be too firm for side sleepers under 250 pounds 
$99 return fee

The Loom and Leaf Mattress comes from Saatva, a brand that makes mattresses that our editors and contributors regularly crown as some of the best for back pain. The Loom and Leaf Mattress is an all-foam cousin to the Saatva Classic Mattress, as it features a quilted organic-cotton cover zoned for more support in the lumbar region to help those who live with back pain. It also comes with a memory foam “crown,” which is a strip of foam underneath the back for even more lumbar reinforcement. The Loom and Leaf has gel memory foam for added comfort and enhanced temperature regulation, plus a transitional foam layer that differs depending on which firmness level you choose. 

We found it’s a little firmer than advertised and is most accommodating for back and stomach sleepers. Our testing also showed it’s easy to move around on, so it’s a great pick for combination sleepers, too. The memory foam has a dense, slow-moving feel, while the pillow top adds a hint of plushness. Just keep in mind it doesn’t have the best motion isolation or cooling abilities compared to other picks on this list. You can learn more in our in-depth Saatva Loom and Leaf review.

Expert tip: Stomach sleepers should opt for the firm model, while back and combination sleepers would likely prefer the relaxed firm model.

Brand firmness rating: Soft (4) and firm (7) | Type: Copper-infused memory foam | Height: 10.5 inches | CertiPUR-US certified: Yes | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Lifetime

Pros:

Two firmness levels give you two opportunities to choose the right profile
Copper-infused foam helps regulate temperature
On sale, you can get a queen size for under $1,000

Cons:

Might be too soft for strict stomach sleepers

The 10.5-inch Layla Memory Foam Mattress, like the Plank, has a flippable design that offers two firmness levels in one. However, the Layla Mattress is much more plush and pressure relieving, ideal for side sleepers who need a soft, contouring mattress to cradle their hips and shoulders. The Layla mattress is one of my favorite memory foam beds. It has a unique feel that’s light and airy, while still maintaining a marshmallowy, doughy profile that people have come to love about the material. I’m a side and stomach sleeper, so I prefer the firm end, but the soft side is a great pick for strict side sleepers under 250 pounds.

The memory foam is copper-infused, which is a conductive material that’s designed to draw body heat away from you for a cooler, more comfortable sleep. Our testing found it did a decent job regulating temperature, but we wouldn’t consider it actively cooling. You can learn more in our full Layla mattress review. Copper is also a natural antimicrobial, which helps protect against the growth of mold, bacteria and other household allergens you don’t want spreading in your bed. There’s also a Layla Hybrid Mattress model that has similar characteristics and that is more accommodating for sleepers over 250 pounds. Our Layla Hybrid review goes into more detail about its performance and feel.

Expert tip: Most side sleepers should consider sleeping on the soft side, but the firm end is softer than advertised and better for combination sleepers.

Brand firmness rating: Medium-firm (7.1) | Type: Gel memory foam | Height: 10 inches | CertiPUR-US certified: Yes | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Lifetime

Pros:

Priced under $1,000
Made with temperature-regulating foams
Good edge support for a foam mattress

Cons:

Might be too firm for those who strictly sleep on their side

If you co-sleep with a partner, you want an accommodating mattress that suits both your sleeping styles and delivers top-notch motion isolation, so your movements don’t disturb each other’s sleep. The Bear Original mattress is the entry-level sister model to our best mattress for couples pick, the Bear Elite Hybrid mattress. The Bear Original is made with open-cell and gel-infused foams that do a great job at isolating motion and providing enhanced temperature regulation if you or your partner run hot. However, we didn’t find this to be an actively cooling mattress in our testing. And while it softened up by the end of our tester’s 30-day run with it, we found it fell around a medium-firm on the mattress scale. This makes it more ideal for back, stomach and combination sleepers who want a responsive memory foam mattress that doesn’t give you a quicksand feel. 

You can also choose to upgrade to the Celliant-infused cover, which is meant to act as a performance fabric that boosts circulation and promotes a more restful sleep, according to the brand. With a price tag under $1,000 for a queen (it can run for $650 if you catch it during a sale), it’s one of the best memory foam mattresses you can get for the money. You can learn more about it in our full Bear Original mattress review.

Expert tip: If you or your partner are an athlete, a runner or you just live an active lifestyle, the Celliant-infused cover is supposed to help aid in the muscle recovery process, according to Bear, and may be worth the extra splurge. 

Why Trust Forbes Vetted

At Forbes Vetted, we’ve published a large library of sleep and mattress articles that contains other memory foam–related guides like the best soft mattresses and the best Tempur-Pedic mattresses.

All of our memory foam recommendations were approved by mattress and sleep editors Bridget Chapman and McKenzie Dillon, who are certified sleep science coaches and professional mattress testers. Collectively, they’ve tested hundreds of mattresses.
Mattress editor or not, our team loves sleep. We relied on feedback from our editors and included some of their favorite memory foam beds in this guide.
In keeping up-to-date on the latest in sleep technology, we regularly revisit this article, including a recent update in September 2024 to provide different mattress selections and our testers’ insights.

How We Chose The Best Memory Foam Mattresses

To find the best memory foam mattresses for an array of sleep styles and nighttime needs, we looked to reputable mattress brands that excel at producing all-foam beds and consulted our team about their favorite models.

Our mattress and sleep editors narrowed down their list to top-rated memory foam models they have tested that offer excellent pressure relief, motion isolation and support.
We weighed our personal experience and considered which beds our editors and writers love; all of the beds above have been tested by our team.
We prioritized beds with stellar customer reviews of at least 4 stars out of 5.
We vetted each mattress to ensure they offer a risk-free trial period and minimum 10-year warranty.
We analyzed additional features like firmness level, cooling technology and CertiPUR-US certification to cater to a variety of sleep needs.

What To Consider When Shopping For The Best Memory Foam Mattresses
Sleeping Position

The firmness and support level you need from a memory foam mattress greatly depends on your sleeping position(s).

Side sleepers typically need a soft to medium-firm mattress in order to get the necessary pressure relief around their hips and shoulders. That said, many memory foam mattresses work for side sleepers since they mold to your body and evenly distribute weight.
Back sleepers should look for a medium-firm to firm memory foam mattress in order to keep their spine in alignment. These sleepers don’t want their hips sinking too far into the bed—or, on the contrary, not sinking enough for pressure-point relief.
Stomach sleepers require a firmer memory foam bed that minimizes sinkage around the midsection to keep the spine in proper alignment. If their hips dip too far into a mattress, it can lead to back pain.
Combo sleepers usually find their sweet spot with a medium-firm mattress since it can accommodate the most sleep positions. However, it’s good to think of the position you sleep in the most throughout the night and let that guide the firmness level you choose.

Body Type/Weight

Despite the general recommendations listed above, keep in mind that a mattress’ feel depends on body weight, too. For example, a medium-firm mattress may feel softer than advertised for someone who weighs over 250 pounds. Most memory foam beds tend to feel softer than an innerspring or hybrid mattress since they don’t contain coils and often support up to 250 pounds per side, or 500 pounds total. If you’re looking for ample support—especially if you’re switching from a traditional innerspring—a firmer option or a mattress specifically designed for heavyweight sleepers may be best.

Trial And Warranty

Each memory foam mattress in our roundup comes with a risk-free trial and warranty policy. The average trial lasts around 100 days, while some go above and beyond with a yearlong trial offer. During your trial period, you can try the mattress out at home to make sure it’s a good fit. Just keep in mind some brands require you to sleep on it for at least 30 nights before initiating a return.

Most memory foam mattresses come with at least a 10-year warranty, but some have policies that last a lifetime. While we don’t recommend that you sleep on the same mattress your whole life, a long warranty speaks to a bed’s craftsmanship and a brand’s confidence. And keep in mind, warranties cover only manufacturer defects and not regular wear and tear.

Cooling Technology

Memory foam is known for trapping heat, so many brands offer infused or perforated foams to enhance cooling and breathability. The three most popular types of memory foam are synthetic, gel-infused and copper-infused. Synthetic foams provide the sink-in, pressure-relieving feel the material is known for, while gel-infused and copper-infused foams help promote more airflow and regulate temperature. If you’re a hot sleeper in need of a cooling mattress, we recommend opting for these infused foams and also taking a look at our list of the best cooling memory foam mattresses.

Here are our expert-approved picks.,http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-hyaluronic-acid-serums/,"A good hyaluronic acid serum keeps skin hydrated and soft, and can easily be incorporated into a skincare routine. While our bodies naturally produce it, production slows down as we age, causing a gradual loss in skin hydration and elasticity. Our top picks for the best hyaluronic acid serums, like the Cosrx The Hyaluronic Acid 3 Serum and The Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum, can help plump dry, flaky skin without causing irritation or sensitivity.

The best hyaluronic acid serums keep skin soft, plump and hydrated.

ILLUSTRATION: FORBES / PHOTO: RETAILERS

When choosing the right formula, pay special attention to the concentration, key ingredients and molecular weight. “I like to look for products that contain multi-molecular weights of hyaluronic acid; they penetrate different depths of the epidermis, giving a plumping effect that is perfect for temporarily improving the appearance of fine lines and crepey skin,” says dermatologist and KilgourMD founder Dr. James Kilgour. After consulting with deputy editor Jane Sung and several experts, we’ve rounded up the best hyaluronic acid serums to rejuvenate your skin.

When it comes to molecular percentage, the lower the number, the smaller the molecular weight and the better it can permeate the skin. Cosrx’s Hyaluronic Acid 3 serum uses a 3% low molecular hyaluronic acid, which penetrates deeper and provides maximum moisture and hydration instantly and over time. This pick is hydrating enough to plump the driest, flakiest skin and lightweight enough to be worn under makeup. Plus, it includes ceramides and an amino acid complex to protect against external stressors.

A few drops of this luxurious serum morning and night help to boost skin elasticity, increase collagen and enhance the skin’s overall appearance. Packed with hyaluronic acid, peptides and a proprietary extract called BioMarine, these ingredients help to soften fine lines and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Isdin’s oil-free, non-comedogenic serum also gives skin a natural light-from-within glow minus the shine, and thanks to lentil extract, pores look more refined.

This serum has two major draws: an accessible price tag and an encapsulated delivery system. The latter means it releases moisture-boosting ingredients like ceramides and hyaluronic acid around the clock, which work together for optimum results. Hyaluronic acid provides instant hydration, and ceramides help protect, repair, and restore damaged skin barrier over time. The consistency, similar to a thin lotion, absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving any sticky residue.

This fairly inconspicuous bottle contains a seriously impressive cocktail of active ingredients. Along with hyaluronic acid, this reparative serum features snow mushroom for added hydration, niacinamide, licorice root, tranexamic acid and three forms of vitamin C, which help fade hyperpigmentation and prevent the appearance of new dark spots. Plus, peptides and purslane help boost collagen formation to minimize the look of fine lines and maximize elasticity in the skin. The formula is also fragrance-free and gentle enough for even the most sensitive skin types.

Although expensive, this effective gel-like serum works as both a humectant to absorb water into the skin and an emollient to lock water into the skin. Its potent blend of pure hyaluronic acid, Proxylane, licorice root and purple rice boosts skin’s hydration levels and helps improve texture and elasticity. Proxylane, a sugar protein found in certain types of wood, targets skin firmness and can help maintain a smooth, youthful complexion.

This serum blends two types of hyaluronic acid—one with a high molecular weight and one low—to provide immediate surface- and deep-level hydration in a single formula. And those with oily or acne-prone skin can rest easy knowing the non-comedogenic formula goes on weightless and won’t exacerbate breakouts. Instead, it works to plump fine lines and smooth bumpy or uneven textures.

Anyone with oily skin would understandably want to avoid using anything too emollient for fear of it making their skin feel greasy. And while this serum is incredibly hydrating, the oil-free liquid gel-like texture melts right into the skin and dries completely matte. Added sodium PCA and silk proteins help reduce the look of fine lines and rough texture, leaving skin smoother and brighter.

You know how the best NBA and MLB teams spend enormous sums of money scouting talent around the world? The best U.S. corporations do the same. A failure to do so comes at the cost of future innovation, and in some instance results in obsolescence altogether.

It’s all a reminder of the why behind Microsoft opening up a large Vancouver-based facility back in 2016. The corporation’s initial intent was to house its additional hires in a Seattle-based location, but for rules set by Congress that limit the amount of talented foreign workers allowed to showcase their skills in the United States.

Ultimately Congress’s rules proved too stringent, thus Microsoft’s pivot north to Vancouver. Canada’s immigration laws aren’t as strict when it comes to corporations hiring those they want to hire.

Which explains the title of this opinion piece. Congress essentially built a major Microsoft facility in Canada with its strict approach to immigration. One of the world’s most valuable companies took its investment elsewhere.

To which some will reply that Congress did and does right by limiting the inflow of foreign workers. Shouldn’t corporations hire Americans first?

Let’s first apply the above question to professional sports teams. Shouldn’t NBA and MLB teams be limited to drafting American players? The answer is that such limits would render American teams quite a bit less competitive. “World Champion” would no longer apply to NBA and MLB champions.

The situation for Microsoft is no different. While it’s on top right now, both domestically and globally, it won’t remain on top if it becomes lax in its hiring practices. Which explains the Vancouver facility yet again.

Microsoft had to place it there simply because the hires it wanted to make were not legal to work in the United States. It’s that basic. In order to add the workers it desired to its operations, Microsoft had to create a facility outside the United States. Thanks Congress.

To which some might still say Congress did right in keeping foreign workers out of the United States. They’re taking American jobs, after all. Not really. Just as the best pro sports teams won’t just hire anyone, neither will the best corporations hire just anyone. Microsoft knew the individuals it wanted to hire, only for it to build a facility outside the U.S. to house its hires.

Crucial about Microsoft’s pivot from Seattle to Vancouver is that is that it didn’t just result in high-paying jobs being filled up north, and out of the U.S. It also resulted in all manner of non-Microsoft jobs winding up in Vancouver.

To understand why, consider Cal-Berkeley professor Enrico Moretti’s 2012 book, The New Geography of Jobs. Moretti noted that there’s a “jobs multiplier” quality to the most successful technology companies. Since their employees operate so ambitiously and are paid so well, many multiples of jobs (think investment bankers, lawyers, sommeliers, chefs, personal trainers, etc.) cluster where technology workers are located. Which is just a reminder that Seattle lost twice when Congress erected barriers to Microsoft hiring the workers it desired.

In the present, the perception remains that immigrants are a burden borne by Americans in the form of lower wages and reduced job opportunity. The perception is backwards. Jobs aren’t finite, rather they’re only limited by investment.

By limiting the arrival of human capital to the U.S., Congress erects barriers to the investment without which there are no companies and no jobs to begin with. Yes, by not allowing the best American companies to hire without regard to U.S. citizenship, Congress powers a “hiring multiplier” outside the United States."

Missing in action for much of the year, there is evidence emerging that ETFs are joining the gold game as small investors are drawn in by worsening geopolitics, and the start of an interest rate falling cycle.

The star performance of gold, which has risen by 59% over the last two years from $1628/oz in late 2022 to a record high of $2582/0z has also created a FOMO effect (fear of missing out).

A survey earlier this month of ETF activity by the World Gold Council, an industry lobby group, found that withdrawals from gold-backed ETFs had started to reverse in May with positive inflows continuing into August, the latest month measured.

North American investors are leading ETF investment, accounting for 17.2 tons of gold in August, comfortably ahead of Europe’s 7.9 tons taking the total amount of gold in ETFs to 3181.7 tons, enough to represent the world’s third largest hoard of gold, more than Italy and France but well short of the 8133.5 tons held by the U.S.

The return of ETFs as an important factor in driving the gold price higher was the subject of a research paper released on Monday by ANZ, an Australian bank, three days before the keenly awaited interest rate decision of the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve.

Jumbo 0.5% rate cut possible

While the widely signalled rate cut has been worked into asset pricing over the past few months it’s the size of the cut which will be most keenly watched with 0.25% seen as a certainty, but a “jumbo” cut of 0.5% possible.

ANZ said it expected a recovery in “strategic investment” in gold would push the price higher.

“A 100-basis point (1%) cut in rates could see 200-to-250 tons of EFT net inflows over the coming months,” the bank said in a comment headed “A golden ascent”.

“The return of strategic investment demand will likely drive the price trajectory upward, potentially reaching $2900/oz by the end of 2025.”

Gold prices are soaring in a bullish market. 

GETTY

Other gold forecasters are more optimistic. Lichtenstein-based banker Ronald-Peter Stoeferle told the Beaver Creek Precious Metals Summit in Colorado last week that the price was on track to reached $4800/oz in 2030.

Falling interest rates, especially lower real rates after allowing for inflation, are expected to act like a magnet for small investors who have spent much of the past 12 months on the sidelines as central banks led the way.

“While market expectations can be volatile, falling interest rates in the coming quarters look certain,” ANZ said.

“We expect 200 basis points (2%) in rate cuts in this monetary easing cycle, which will pave the way for lower real rates.

Structural Price Drivers

“The structural drivers for gold’s price, lower yields and a weaker U.S. dollar, will be increasingly supportive after their inverse relationship weakened during the tightening cycle of 2022-23.

“Strong central bank purchases and resilient physical demand will be joined by healthy inflows into gold-back ETFs.

“We expect gold prices to move towards $2700/oz in the short term and reach a high of $2900/oz by the end of 2025.”"

GETTY

The national parks were founded more than a century ago as a way to protect and preserve America’s most scenic destinations, so it may seem contradictory to think about the economic prowess of these special places. But the parks draw lots of visitors—in fact, millions of travelers descend each year on the most popular ones—so it’s not surprising the parks are substantial economic drivers for the regions where they're located. Now, a new report from the National Park Service helps quantify the value of the parks economy: Visitors to national parks spent an estimated $26.4 billion in local gateway regions in 2023, which is up 10% from 2022.

Are National Parks Good For the Economy?

National parks can benefit gateway communities in a number of ways, with parks visitors spending money on everything from hotels to meals to souvenirs and renting sports equipment from local outfitters.

Lodging is the sector that benefits the most from national park visitation, with $9.9 billion spent on hotels, glamping outposts, lodges, and other overnight accommodations, according to the report. National park visitors also spent $558 million on campsites.

Next up, restaurants received a $5.2 billion infusion from national park traveler in 2023. Gas stations fueling national parks road trips bring in $2.8 billion and recreation companies providing equipment rental and guided tours pulled in $2.2 billion.

(This chart helps visualize spending at national parks).

Last year’s extra economic boost correlates with an increase in national parks visits.

In 2023, the park service recorded 325,498,646 visits, which is up 13 million (or 4 %) from 2022. The park service data also shows an increase in off-season visitation, with the spring and fall becoming more popular at many parks when compared with previous years.

Which National Parks Bring in the Most Money?

GETTY

In total, the National Park System includes 429 areas that cover 85 million acres.

But, you may be curious about which ones have the highest economic impact and attract the most visitor spending?

The Great Smoky Mountains, which are divided between Tennessee and North Carolina, drummed up $2.19 billion dollars in visitor spending, making the park the most economically valuable national park. This isn’t too surprising when you consider the park records more than 13 million recreational visits in a year, which is the highest visitation of any of the national parks and is more than Yosemite, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon combined.

The Smokies are surrounded by popular tourist destinations on the Tennessee side, including Gaitlinburg and Pigeon Forge. Bryson City on the North Carolina side is close to the park, but more known for being laid-back, drawing outdoorsy travelers who come to see the park and go whitewater rafting on the Nantahala River.

Here’s the list of the five national park sites that spur the most visitor spending:

X-Rated Olympic Posters?

What if your Olympic poster was so controversial that some countries labeled it “immoral” and some forbade it altogether in public places?

That is exactly what happened to Stockholm, Sweden. Stockholm was awarded the 5th modern games in 1912. Swedish leaders realized the Olympic poster had extraordinary importance for advertising and promoting their country in advance of the games by creating a poster their representatives would take to other countries in advance for advertising this global event. They launched a national competition later won by an artist from the Swedish Royal National Academy: Professor Olle Hjortzberg.

His work featured a nude male athlete unfurling the Swedish flag as behind him athletes waved flags of other participating nations.

Strategic ribbons were also added to preserve the modesty of the figures.

The Stockholm 1912 poster is considered a design classic but unfortunately caused huge controversy at the time because of its nudity. Organizers noted that the poster was banned in 266 places abroad.

When it was displayed at a railway station in The Netherlands, local authorities confiscated the poster and claimed it was ""in the highest degree immoral"".

And the official Olympic report noted that, in China, the postmaster general had forbidden the exhibition of the poster as it was ""offensive to Chinese ideas of dignity"".

The poster was beautifully and professionally drawn. And In spite of (or perhaps because of) the controversy, it would became one of the best known Olympic posters in the modern era."

Chase Dollander and Sean Sullivan, drafted one-two by Colorado a year ago, are a right wing and left wing respectively receiving acclaim from everybody in 2024.

It is Hartford’s first playoff trip since becoming a Rockies farm team in 2016 and first since 2009, when the club was the Rock Cats, a Minnesota Twins affiliate based in nearby New Britain, and lost in the league semifinals.

Dollander is 2-1 with a 2.25 earned run average in nine starts since being called up from High-A Spokane in mid-July. Sullivan is 2-0 with a 1.97 ERA in seven starts since coming up on August 3.

“It was our history with him, the hours of scouting him not only this year but even going back to his freshman year,” Rockies senior director of scouting operations Marc Gustafson told MLB.com about the pick. “Combine that with his body, size, strength, stuff, he checked all the boxes for us.”

The 6-foot-2, 200-pounder was considered the top pitching prospect in the nation after a sensational 2022 season for the Volunteers. He went 10-0 with 108 strikeouts, 13 walks and 2.39 ERA 79 innings. In 2023, however, he slumped to 7-6 with a 4.75 ERA and fell on the draft board.

“He made some mechanical adjustments that, probably, he didn’t need to make,” Rockies general manager Bill Schmidt said a year ago. “He was trying to get better, making some tweaks. But he’s got to tweak them back.”

He has. The right-hander fanned 10 or more in four of his 14 starts for Spokane, going 4-1 with a 2.63 ERA. In 118 innings over 23 starts overall, he is 6-2 with a 2.59 ERA, allowing 94 hits and 47 walks while striking out an eye-popping 169.

Sullivan’s first start at Spokane one night after Dollander’s gem was even more overpowering. In six innings, the lefty fanned 13 without a walk, yielding one run on five hits. He also whiffed 10 or more four times before being called up, going 7-2 with a 2.16 ERA.

Overall, Sullivan has a 9-2 record, 2.11 ERA in 21 starts. In115 1/3 innings, he has yielded 90 hits and only 15 walks while striking out 125.

He got a $1.7 million signing bonus as the Rockies’ second pick, No. 46 overall, in the 2022 MLB Draft out of Wake Forest.

“He struck out guys,” Schmidt said then. “Hitters had problems picking up his stuff. He’s left-handed with a very quality slider and angle to his fastball.”

The 6-4, 190-pounder has an odd delivery that helps confounder batters.

A Matter Of Odd Anatomy

It is physically impossible though an absolute given that the Rockies’ arms have been the franchise’s Achilles’ heel.

In 32 seasons, they have finished above .500 only eight times. The best team ERA mark was 4.14 in 2010. That was only ninth-best in the National League that year though helped Colorado go 83-79. The worst ERA was a lofty 6.01 in 1999. The 2023 club that had a 59-103 record had the next-worst ERA at 5.67.

A Nied From The Start

Colorado’s altitude and ballpark have traditionally frustrated pitchers and helped hitters. From their inception, the Rockies have continually sought better pitching and seldom struck the mother lode.

On Nov. 17, 1992, the fledgling franchise made what was universally acclaimed as a bright move by making right-hander David Nied the first pick of the expansion draft. At age 23 that year, he had a 3-0 record and 1.17 ERA as a rookie for the Atlanta Braves. Atlanta already has future Hall of Famers Tom Glavine and John Smoltz in its rotation was negotiating to add a third, which they did two weeks later in Greg Maddux.

Nied started the Rockies’ historic first game, a 3-0 loss to the New York Mets. He beat the Mets in his third start, a complete game.

He developed a sore arm and pitched in only 30 games the next three years, retiring at age 27.

A Never-Ending Search

Mike Hampton had a 91-60 record for the Houston Astros and New York Mets over seven seasons. The Rockies signed him to an eight-year, $121 million deal. The lefty went 21-28 with a 5.75 ERA and was traded to Atlanta. The next three years, he had a combined 32-20 record.

These are two prime examples of successful veterans expected to help and did not. Dollander and Sullivan have high expectations as youngsters. If they can turn hope and hype into success, the Rockies may finally have found reliable pitchers."

In today’s column, I identify and arm you with brand new tips and techniques about prompting and prompt engineering, doing so because of the newly released OpenAI o1 generative AI model. You might say that this latest advancement in generative AI changes the landscape of how to best do your prompts.

To be clear, you aren’t starting over.

Instead, there are crucial twists and turns that you’ll need to upgrade your prompt engineering skills on. No worries. This will pretty much be a piece of cake if you are mindful of prompting and willing to adapt to the new nuances in this kind of generative AI.

I am going to assume that you are already versed generally in prompting and know much of the fundamentals. You might find of use my comprehensive overview of over fifty key prompting and prompting engineering techniques and recommendations at the link here. If you are starting at ground zero and know nothing about generative AI and prompting, this could be a bit of an uphill battle, and I’d stridently suggest first getting up to speed. Your choice.

This posting is the fourth in my assessment and review series about the OpenAI o1 generative model. I will share here a quick glimpse at some of the new features of o1 that are causing you to change your prompting prowess.

For my general overview and comprehensive look at what o1 entails, which is in the first part of this series, see the link here. Part two discussed how chain-of-thought or CoT includes double-checking now and ergo tends to thankfully reduce so-called AI hallucinations and other problematic issues, see the link here. Part three examined how the chain-of-thought feature can also be used to catch generative AI being deceptive, though this is more experimental than it is yet put into full practice, see the link here.

This is part four and covers prompting insights.

Here’s the deal about o1.

OpenAI’s newly released generative AI is known as o1. The name is a bit confusing, and some are informally referring to this version as GPT-o1, ChatGPT-o1, and by its rumored internal name of Strawberry, but let’s just proceed here by referring to the generative AI as the official name of o1.

First, o1 is not at this time a considered upgrade from GPT-4o or ChatGPT. You might have assumed that this would be the next in their series of generative AI apps. Not really the case. This is more so an experimental release of something that is kind of like the others but different in other ways too. A hodgepodge, if you will. I’ll say more about this shortly.

Second, one of the biggest changes is that they have opted to include chain-of-thought directly woven into the inner mechanisms of o1. This is a monumental change and worthy of close attention. The upshot is that chain-of-thought happens now, automatically. You have no choice in the matter. Chain-of-thought will seemingly run for all prompts. Boom, drop the mic.

Some background about chain-of-thought might be handy here as a reminder of the importance of this essential technique and technology.

Practitioners and empirical research have clearly demonstrated that if you ask generative AI to proceed on a stepwise basis, considered to be a chain-of-thought approach, the results usually come out better, see my in-depth analysis at the link here. Happy face. The downside is that by getting AI to show each of the steps, the runtime effort elongates, the response time is extended or delayed, and if you are paying for your generative AI usage the cost will go up accordingly. Sad face.

It is a learned hunch-based tradeoff of whether the benefits of potentially better results — but not guaranteed to be better — are worth the delay in time and added costs.

Those who are versed in prompting know that leaning into the use of chain-of-thought as a core prompting technique should always be at the forefront of your prompting engineering mindset. I use the “Think a step at a time” wording or something akin to it, in my daily prompting actions. The payoff is mighty handsome. Not all the time, but enough of the time with judicious selection such that there is often tremendous value in engaging a chain-of-thought process in generative AI.

An entire mini-industry has arisen regarding chain-of-thought prompting. I’ve covered a barrel full of them. For example, there is chain-of-thought amplified with factored decomposition at the link here, skeleton-of-thought at the link here, chain-of-feedback at the link here, verification-of-thought at the link here, chain-of-density at the link here, tree-of-thoughts at the link here, and my comprehensive coverage of other CoT-related prompting techniques and prompt engineering fundamentals at the link here.

Okay, the above sets the table for what I want to say about changing up your prompting considerations.

You are now ready for my latest set of prompting tips based on the o1 model:

(1) New vital tip about chain-of-thought. For this type of generative AI, no longer use prompts invoking chain-of-thought activity since it automatically is happening.
(2) Emphasize your prompt simplicity. Avoid especially complicated prompts and try to be immensely straightforward.
(3) Be highly distinctive within your prompts. Make sure to use explicit delimiters in prompts to distinguish various elements.
(4) Streamline your RAG. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for in-context modeling needs to be streamlined.
(5) Invisibility counts now. Be mindful of visible tokens and invisible tokens for size and cost considerations.
(6) Watch out for domain narrowness. Realize that this AI for now shines in rather narrow ways and likely falters in everyday broader ways. Watch out.

Before I jump into describing those tips, I want to abundantly and notably state that those tips are only relevant to o1. Please keep that fully in mind.

Do not suddenly abide by those tips when you are using other generative AI. Most of the rest of the world of generative AI is still unlike o1. Use your already in-hand prompting techniques for the likes of ChatGPT, GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, and so on, just as you always have.

Only switch over to the above tips when you opt to use o1. I realize that is a bit of an annoyance. Switching your mindset and your hat to the o1 approach is on your shoulders. That being said, I expect that we will soon enough see other generative AI apps adopt similar new internal mechanisms that might very well mean that these tips will apply to their new wares too.

I’ll certainly keep you posted.

Brief Explanation About The Six Prompting Tips

Hold onto your hat as I proceed at a fast clip to explain the six tips.

You used to invoke chain-of-thought by mentioning “Think a step at a time” or akin wording inside a prompt. Don’t do that anymore when it comes to using o1. Suppress the urge.

Why?

Because o1 automatically does a chain-of-thought.

As far as we can tell at this juncture, the AI developers decided to hard-wire this into o1. This is smart due to the AI now likely tending toward better answers. It can be frustrating for users since this adds delay in processing and boosts costs. Most of all, you have no choice in the matter. It is going to occur. Period, end of story.

I am sure some of you quick-witted types will say that you will compose a prompt that tells o1 to explicitly not do a chain-of-thought. There you go, humans regain control. However, initial experiments suggest that this is brushed aside and rebuffed. The beast wants what it wants.

Another clever idea is to mess with the automatic chain-of-thought by telling it to be briefer, or maybe telling it to be longer. So far, again, initial experiments suggest this is turned aside.

Worse still, it seems that if you do ask for a chain-of-thought, you are forcing o1 into doing double duty and the results might get ugly. Think of it this way. When the engine of your car is already running, and you try to turn the key, what happens? Usually, an ugly noise and you might harm your car. The same seems to be the case with o1.

Your request to do a chain-of-thought has seemingly nothing to do with the automatic one in the sense that you are layering a second chain-of-thought upon the automatic one. The automatic chain-of-thought might seemingly try to do a chain-of-thought on the chain-of-thought that you’ve requested. Do you see how this can grind the gears? I tell you; it is almost like the movie Inception if you know what I mean.

Okay, so the first tip is that with o1, set aside your instincts and training on invoking a chain of thought. It is going to happen without you lifting a finger. Furthermore, if you try to do a chain-of-thought, maybe it will cause matter and anti-matter to intertwine, and the universe will spontaneously implode. I warned you.

The rest of the tips are a bit more straight-ahead.

The o1 doesn’t seem to relish complicated prompts. Keep your prompts to the best simplicity you can. I would say this is a general rule of thumb for most generative AI. With o1, it almost seems a necessity now.

Inside of your prompts, make sure to use delimiters to offset anything that you want to be distinctive. Again, this is a good general rule of thumb for generative AI. In the case of o1, especially so.

If you are going to import data by using retrieval-augmented generative or RAG and do in-context modeling, see my explanation about this popular technique at the link here, the world of o1 makes this less easy-going. You will need to put extra elbow grease and homework into preparing the data and carrying out the RAG process. Sorry, that’s the way the ball bounces.

A bit of an interesting offshoot of the automatic chain-of-thought is that the consideration regarding size and cost gets more complex. You undoubtedly know that most generative AI usually count tokens as the means of figuring out the memory size and cost of your usage, see my discussion about such aspects at the link here.

Conventionally, you count the number of prompt words as roughly tokens (multiplied by a factor) and the response words generated as tokens (multiplied by a factor). That still is something you need to do to gauge whether you are within size limits and how much you will be charged for your usage.

The trick now is that there are so-called visible tokens and an added set of invisible tokens. The visible tokens are the same as before, the prompt tokens and the generated results tokens. Those invisible tokens have to do with the automatic chain-of-thought. You are getting dinged for the automatic activity based on additional token counts. You can’t see them per se, and you can’t stop them per se, but you will absolutely consume them and pay for them. Lucky you.

Consider your online memory and cost considerations correspondingly.

The final of the six tips is that o1 is currently set up to do well in narrow domains, especially in science, mathematics, and programming or coding. Those do on the whole better than traditional generative AI. On all other facets, all bets are off. Your results from o1 might be on par with other generative AI or worse when it comes to anything beyond that handful of selected domains.

Bottom line, right now, use o1 for playing around, or for specific questions or problems in those narrow domains, but otherwise stick with the generative AI that you know and love. Other generative AI apps are shall we say, generalists and do reasonably well across-the-board. The o1 is at this time more focused on a narrow set of specialties.

Now you know.

OpenAI Has Posted Further Nuances

For those of you who want to dig deeper into these matters, make sure to look at the OpenAI blog site for their “Reasoning Models” Beta blog description, of which here are a few excerpts:

“Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to ""think step by step"" or ""explain your reasoning"" is unnecessary.”
“Some prompt engineering techniques, like few-shot prompting or instructing the model to ‘think step by step,’ may not enhance performance and can sometimes hinder it.”
“Keep prompts simple and direct: The models excel at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions without the need for extensive guidance.”
“Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.”
“Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response.”
“Each completion has an upper limit on the maximum number of output tokens—this includes both the invisible reasoning tokens and the visible completion tokens.”
“It's important to ensure there's enough space in the context window for reasoning tokens when creating completions. Depending on the problem's complexity, the models may generate anywhere from a few hundred to tens of thousands of reasoning tokens.”

I plucked out excerpts that pertain to this discussion and that I believe are the biggest bang for your buck when it comes to rejiggering your prompting skills.

Conclusion

Congratulations, you are now knowledgeable about changes to prompting that are needed if you wish to effectively use o1.

If you aren’t going to use o1, these changes are of little consequence to you, other than acting as a heads-up of what the future might hold for advances in generative AI. For those of you who are going to at least try out o1, these prompt tips are notable. And those of you who are going to go whole-hog into o1, you will need to live and breathe these prompting insights.

May your prompts always go well, and your use of generative AI be all sunshine and roses."
mindset shifts for improving financial health,forbes,Small Investors Join The Gold Rush Via ETFs With $2900/oz In Sight,After the early work of central banks and high net worth individuals it’s time for small investors to drive the gold higher as they shift funds into gold-backed ETFs.,http://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/09/16/small-investors-join-the-gold-rush-via-etfs-with-2900oz-in-sight/,"After the early work of central banks and high net worth individuals it’s time for small investors to drive the gold price higher as they shift funds into gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with $2900 an ounce the next milestone.

Missing in action for much of the year, there is evidence emerging that ETFs are joining the gold game as small investors are drawn in by worsening geopolitics, and the start of an interest rate falling cycle.

The star performance of gold, which has risen by 59% over the last two years from $1628/oz in late 2022 to a record high of $2582/0z has also created a FOMO effect (fear of missing out).

A survey earlier this month of ETF activity by the World Gold Council, an industry lobby group, found that withdrawals from gold-backed ETFs had started to reverse in May with positive inflows continuing into August, the latest month measured.

North American investors are leading ETF investment, accounting for 17.2 tons of gold in August, comfortably ahead of Europe’s 7.9 tons taking the total amount of gold in ETFs to 3181.7 tons, enough to represent the world’s third largest hoard of gold, more than Italy and France but well short of the 8133.5 tons held by the U.S.

The return of ETFs as an important factor in driving the gold price higher was the subject of a research paper released on Monday by ANZ, an Australian bank, three days before the keenly awaited interest rate decision of the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve.

Jumbo 0.5% rate cut possible

While the widely signalled rate cut has been worked into asset pricing over the past few months it’s the size of the cut which will be most keenly watched with 0.25% seen as a certainty, but a “jumbo” cut of 0.5% possible.

ANZ said it expected a recovery in “strategic investment” in gold would push the price higher.

“A 100-basis point (1%) cut in rates could see 200-to-250 tons of EFT net inflows over the coming months,” the bank said in a comment headed “A golden ascent”.

“The return of strategic investment demand will likely drive the price trajectory upward, potentially reaching $2900/oz by the end of 2025.”

Gold prices are soaring in a bullish market. 

GETTY

Other gold forecasters are more optimistic. Lichtenstein-based banker Ronald-Peter Stoeferle told the Beaver Creek Precious Metals Summit in Colorado last week that the price was on track to reached $4800/oz in 2030.

Falling interest rates, especially lower real rates after allowing for inflation, are expected to act like a magnet for small investors who have spent much of the past 12 months on the sidelines as central banks led the way.

“While market expectations can be volatile, falling interest rates in the coming quarters look certain,” ANZ said.

“We expect 200 basis points (2%) in rate cuts in this monetary easing cycle, which will pave the way for lower real rates.

Structural Price Drivers

“The structural drivers for gold’s price, lower yields and a weaker U.S. dollar, will be increasingly supportive after their inverse relationship weakened during the tightening cycle of 2022-23.

“Strong central bank purchases and resilient physical demand will be joined by healthy inflows into gold-back ETFs.

“We expect gold prices to move towards $2700/oz in the short term and reach a high of $2900/oz by the end of 2025.”"
mindset shifts for improving financial health,forbes,Musicians For Kamala Livestream Brings Music Industry Together,"Dozens of top-name musicians, from all genres, have pooled their talents to help get Kamala Harris to the White House in November. I spoke with two organizers.",http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2024/09/16/musicians-for-kamala-livestream-brings-music-industry-together/,"The final poster for the Musicians for Kamala livestream tomorrow, September 17 at 8 EST. 

MUSICIANS FOR KAMALA

Tomorrow, September 17, at 8 EST, a wide array of musicians, from Moby, The Flaming Lips Wayne Coyne and Bootsy Collins to Roseanne Cash, Sheila E and Mickey Guyton will pool their collective talents into a two-hour plus streaming telethon called Musicians for Kamala.

The event, intended to raise money for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential run, is a collective endeavor between the music industry and political experts. People who want to tune in to see Lisa Loeb, Living Colour, Jack Johnson, Sage Bava, just added Evanescence and more, as well as appearances from Natalie Merchant, Shepard Fairey and more, can RSVP at MUSICIANS FOR KAMALA: A NATIONAL LIVESTREAM MUSICAL EVENT · The Democratic National Committee (democrats.org) where they will receive a link to join.

I spoke with two of the co-organizers, Jacob Tell and Nancy Rotering, about putting the event together.

Steve Baltin: There is a great history of protest music. Why is music such an important part of propelling political messages?

Jacob Tell: Music is an enduring force and the universal language. It fosters a sense of unity and common purpose, transcending barriers of language, race, class & geography. Most importantly, music moves our hearts and minds. Songs can serve as slogans, mantras, and rallying cries, and have the potential to create a sense of belonging in a movement, giving us something bigger than ourselves to believe in. Music moves people to take action.

Nancy Rotering: So much of successful political messaging is based on storytelling evoking emotions that results in action. Music often achieves the same outcome and can almost serve as shorthand for political messaging and its goals.

Baltin: When did that translate into the importance of musician endorsements?

Tell: Musicians hold a unique platform of influence, capable of amplifying messages that resonate on a deep societal level. Their powerful lyrics can give voice to the voiceless and raise awareness for issues that ripple across communities. The importance of musician endorsements lies in their ability to bring mass attention to causes, inspiring their audiences to engage and take action. For example, touring with and supporting musician Jack Johnson for over two decades taught me the importance of his deeply embedded environmental message in every facet of his work—from his music and live performances to his merchandise, foundations, and record label. His fans respond to this purpose driven form of expression, creating deep lasting connections. This kind of consistent, authentic advocacy shows how musicians can create lasting impact through their endorsements.

Rotering: Musicians as storytellers often develop signature motifs with a direct translation to political calls to action. Those who share similar values with their fans communicate in a unique and compelling way unmatched by other voices. Having their endorsement speaks efficiently and impactfully to their fans.

Baltin: How was the response to putting this event together?

Rotering: People were very excited to be involved; so much so, that we have more musicians than time and we will be creating a space for continued musical performance and engagement. Throughout the Harris-Walz campaign, there has been great enthusiasm by voters in connecting over shared interests and/or identities. The strong support for the candidates is enhanced through the broad range of communities being celebrated. So much of this campaign has been about recognizing the strength that comes from the diversity within our great nation, and events like Musicians for Kamala amplify that joy and sense of community, hopefully leading to increased political engagement.

Tell: The response to organizing this event has been incredibly inspiring. I was motivated by seeing other “For Kamala” livestream events— Black Women, White Dudes, Comedians, and Deadheads—come together. With my background in marketing, events, and the music industry, I knew that a “Musicians for Kamala” event could be a success if we built the right team. My passionate friends and longtime collaborators, John Lucchetti and Erik Koral, were the first to join. Then, we brought on Highland Park, Illinois Mayor Nancy Rotering, along with Shelly Hartman, and the Harris-Walz campaign. Soon after, Jeff Atlas and his Backhand Productions team came on board, and dozens of us began collaborating on daily production calls. The collective passion and energy has been overwhelming. Once the website, social media, and press release went live, we were introduced to an influx of management groups, publicists, record labels, and artists eager to participate and support this campaign.

Baltin: What do you hope people take away from this event?

Tell: What I hope people take away from this event is a sense of unity and purpose. First and foremost, I want people to understand the critical importance of registering to vote and exercising that right. Voting is our collective voice, and it’s essential for shaping the future we all care so deeply about. I also hope people see how music connects us across differences, creating a powerful bond that transcends individual backgrounds. We’re united not only by our shared love for music but also by a common passion to support Kamala Harris in her presidential bid. This event is about more than just politics—it’s about coming together to build a future that reflects the beauty, diversity, and strength of our society.

Rotering: I hope that in addition to having an exciting and entertaining experience, people take away the importance of political engagement by registering to vote, volunteering, donating, talking to other voters, and absolutely making a plan to vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the November election."

Former President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new cryptocurrency platform Monday run by his sons—as the ex-president has warmed to the industry since launching his latest campaign for president, despite previously disavowing crypto during his time in office.

Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign ... [+]

AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES
KEY FACTS

Trump is expected to formally debut the platform, dubbed World Liberty Financial, in a discussion on X Spaces later Monday, a launch he’s been promoting for weeks, including in a video posted to his X account last week, where he said “we’re embracing the future with crypto and leaving the slow and outdated big banks behind.""

The platform will presumably operate similar to others such as Coinbase, Gemini and Binance, charging users fees to trade cryptocurrencies, and it could eventually incorporate its own token, referred to as WLFI, Coindesk reported, citing an anonymous source familiar with the company’s plans.

World Liberty Financial, which will be run by Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is the latest crypto-centric move that represents a reversal for Trump since his time in office—when he trashed crypto as “highly volatile and based on thin air,” he tweeted in 2019.

In 2021, Trump told Fox Business bitcoin seems like a “scam,” and called crypto a “disaster waiting to happen” that “takes the edge off of the dollar and the importance of the dollar,” arguing that the U.S. should “regulate [crypto] very, very high.”

Trump—and the Republican Party as a whole—have warmed to crypto, apparently seeing an opening to court donors and bash Democrats as the industry has been angered by a Securities and Exchange Commission crackdown on bad actors and attempts at regulations under President Joe Biden, what Trump has described as a “war on crypto.”

Trump has pledged to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler if he’s re-elected, began taking campaign donations in crypto in May, chose longtime crypto ally Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as his running mate and announced his support for bitcoin mining, as miners have battled with the Biden administration over the electricity consumption required to process transactions.

Trump has also successfully courted donors in the digital currency space throughout his 2024 campaign, begun selling Trump-branded non-fungible tokens, and is personally invested in crypto, promising he’d be a “crypto president.”

WHAT TO WATCH FOR

Trump is set to discuss World Liberty Financial on X Spaces Monday at 8 p.m. EDT.

KEY BACKGROUND

Few details have been made public about World Liberty Financial. Eric Trump has said the platform will promote “financial independence.” Trump’s youngest son, Barron Trump, will be the project’s “DeFi [decentralized finance]

visionary,” according to a white paper obtained by CoinDesk. The company promised in a series of tweets earlier this month describing its objectives to drive “the mass adoption of stablecoins,” a type of digital currency that aims to have a 1:1 exchange rate with government-issued currencies, including the dollar. Seventy percent of the company’s tokens will go to founders, team and service providers and the remaining 30% will be distributed via public sale, CoinDesk reported, noting the 70% reserved for insiders is uncharacteristically high compared to other platforms. The platform was initially dubbed “The DeFiant Ones” when Trump announced it on Truth Social in August, writing “for too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites,” he wrote, adding “it’s time we take a stand—together.”

best practices for budgeting personal finances,investopedia,"What Is Personal Finance, and Why Is It Important?",Personal finance is about managing your budget and how best to put your money to work to realize your financial independence and goals.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp,"Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities.
Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.
Personal finance is about meeting your personal financial goals. These goals could be anything—having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It depends on your income, spending, saving, investing, and personal protection (insurance and estate planning).
Not understanding how to manage finances or be financially disciplined has led Americans to accumulate enormous debt. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reported household debt had increased by $3.7 trillion since December 2019, prior to the recession. In addition, the following balances increased from the first quarter of 2024 to the second:
1
Student loans remained unchanged, at about $1.6 trillion.
Americans are taking on an ever-increasing amount of debt to finance purchases, making managing personal finances more critical than ever, especially when inflation is eating away at purchasing power and prices are rising.

The five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.
Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.
Spending is an outflow of cash and typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever an individual uses their income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.
Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. Individuals must ensure their spending is less than their income; otherwise, they won't have enough money to cover their expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high-interest rates credit cards charge.
Savings is the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have at least a portion of savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.
Beyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.
Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.
Investing can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through readings and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.
Protection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such as illnesses or accidents, and as a means to preserve wealth. Protection includes life and health insurance and estate and retirement planning.
Several financial planning services fall under one or more of the five areas. You're likely to find many businesses that provide these services to clients to help them plan and manage their finances. These services include:
The sooner you start financial planning, the better, but it’s never too late to create financial goals to give yourself and your family financial security and freedom. Here are the best practices and tips for personal finance.
It's all for nothing if you don't know how much you bring home after taxes and withholding. So before deciding anything, ensure you know exactly how much take-home pay you receive.
A budget is essential to living within your means and saving enough to meet your long-term goals. The 50/30/20 budgeting method offers a great framework. It breaks down like this:
It’s never been easier to manage money, thanks to a growing number of smartphone personal budgeting apps that put day-to-day finances in the palm of your hand. Here are just two examples:
It’s important to “pay yourself first” to ensure money is set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, a significant car repair, day-to-day expenses if you get laid off, and more. The ideal safety net is three to 12 months of living expenses.
Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. Once you’ve filled up your emergency fund, don’t stop. Continue funneling the monthly 20% toward other financial goals, such as a retirement fund or a down payment on a home.
It sounds simple enough: Don't spend more than you earn to keep debt from getting out of hand. But, of course, most people have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous—for example, if it leads to acquiring an asset. Taking out a mortgage to buy a house might be one such case. Still, leasing sometimes can be more economical than buying outright, whether renting a property, leasing a car, or even getting a subscription to computer software.
On the other hand, minimizing repayments (to interest only, for instance) can free up income to invest elsewhere or put into retirement savings while you’re young when your nest egg gets the maximum benefit from compounding interest. Some private and federal student loans are even eligible for a rate reduction if the borrower enrolls in auto pay.
2
Student loans account for $1.59 trillion of consumer debt—if you have an outstanding student loan, you should prioritize it.
1
 There are myriad loan repayment plans and payment reduction strategies available. If you’re stuck with a high interest rate, paying off the principal faster can make sense.
Flexible federal repayment programs worth checking out include:
3
Credit cards can be major debt traps, but it’s unrealistic not to own any in the contemporary world. Furthermore, they have applications beyond buying things. They are crucial to establishing your credit rating and a great way to track spending, which can be a considerable budgeting aid.
Credit needs to be managed correctly, meaning you should pay off your entire balance every month or keep your credit utilization ratio at a minimum (that is, keep your account balances below 30% of your total available credit).
4
Given the extraordinary reward and incentives offered these days (such as cashback), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible—if you can pay your bills in full.
Using a debit card, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for accumulated small purchases over an extended period with interest.
Credit cards are the primary vehicle through which your credit score is built and maintained, so watching credit spending goes hand in hand with monitoring your credit score. If you ever want to obtain a lease, mortgage, or any other type of financing, then you’ll need a solid credit report. There are a variety of credit scores available, but the most popular one is the FICO score.
5
Factors that determine your FICO score include:
6
FICO scores are calculated from 300 to 850.

 Here’s how your credit is rated:

To pay bills, set up direct debiting where possible (so you never miss a payment) and subscribe to reporting agencies that provide regular credit score updates. In addition, you can detect and address mistakes or fraudulent activity by monitoring your credit report. Federal law allows you to obtain free credit reports once a year from the “Big Three” major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
9
Reports can be obtained directly from each agency, or you can sign up at AnnualCreditReport.com, a federally authorized site sponsored by the Big Three.
Some credit card providers, such as Capital One, will provide customers with complimentary, regular credit score updates, but it may not be your FICO score. Instead, Capital One's CreditWise program offers your VantageScore.

To protect the assets in your estate and ensure that your wishes are followed when you die, be sure you make a will and—depending on your needs—possibly set up one or more trusts. You also should look into insurance and find ways to reduce your premiums, if possible: auto, home, life, disability, and long-term care (LTC). Periodically review your policy to ensure it meets your family’s needs through life’s major milestones.
Other critical documents include a living will and a healthcare power of attorney. While not all of these documents directly affect you, all of them can save your next of kin considerable time and expense when you fall ill or become otherwise incapacitated.
Retirement may seem like a lifetime away, but it arrives much sooner than expected. Experts suggest that most people will need about 80% of their current salary in retirement. The younger you start, the more you benefit from what advisors call the magic of compounding interest—how small amounts grow over time.
Setting aside money now for your retirement not only allows it to grow over the long term but also can reduce your current income taxes if funds are placed in a tax-advantaged plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA), a 401(k), or a 403(b).
If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, start paying into it immediately, especially if your employer matches your contribution. By not doing so, you’re giving up free money. Take time to learn the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) if your company offers both.
Investing is only one part of planning for retirement. Other strategies include waiting as long as possible before opting to receive Social Security benefits (which is smart for most people) and converting a term life insurance policy to permanent life.
As you age, it's natural for you to accumulate many of the same things your parents did—a family, home or apartment, belongings, and health issues. Insurance can be expensive if you wait too long to get it. Health care, long-term care insurance, life insurance; it all increases in cost the older you get. Additionally, you never know what life will send your way. If you're the sole breadwinner for the family, or you and your partner both work to make ends meet, a lot depends on your ability to work.
Insurance can cover most of the hospital bills as you age, leaving your hard-earned savings in your family's hands; medical expenses are one of the leading reasons for debt.
12
 If something happens to you, life insurance can give those you leave behind a buffer zone to deal with the loss and get back on their feet financially.
Due to an overly complex tax code, many people leave hundreds or even thousands of dollars sitting on the table every year. By maximizing your tax savings, you’ll free up money that can be invested in your reduction of past debts, enjoyment of the present, and plans for the future.
You should start saving receipts and tracking expenditures for all possible tax deductions and tax credits. Many office supply stores sell helpful “tax organizers” that have the main categories already labeled.
After you’re organized, you’ll want to focus on taking advantage of every tax deduction and credit available, as well as deciding between the two when necessary. In short, a tax deduction reduces the amount of income on which you are taxed, whereas a tax credit reduces the amount of tax that you owe. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will save you much more than a $1,000 deduction.
13
Budgeting and planning can seem full of deprivations. Make sure you reward yourself now and then. Whether it’s a vacation, a purchase, or an occasional night on the town, you need to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Doing so gives you a taste of the financial independence you’re working so hard for.
Last but not least, don’t forget to delegate when needed. Even though you might be competent enough to do your own taxes or manage a portfolio of individual stocks, it doesn’t mean you should. Setting up an account at a brokerage and spending a few hundred dollars on a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner—at least once—might be a good way to jump-start your planning.
The key to getting your finances on the right track is using skills you likely already have. It’s also about understanding that the principles that contribute to success in business and your career work just as well in personal money management. Three key skills are finance prioritization, assessing the costs and benefits, and restraining your spending.
Personal money management isn't one of the most popular topics in educational systems. Many college degrees require some financial education, but it isn't geared toward individuals, which means that most of us will need to get our personal finance education from our parents (if we’re lucky) or learn it ourselves.
Fortunately, you don’t have to spend much money to find out how to manage it better. You can learn everything you need to know for free online and in library books. Almost all media publications regularly dole out personal finance advice, too.
Reading personal finance blogs is a great way to start learning about personal finance. Instead of the general advice you’ll get in personal finance articles, you’ll learn exactly which challenges real people face and how they address them.
Mr. Money Mustache has hundreds of posts full of insights on escaping the rat race and retiring early by making unconventional lifestyle choices. CentSai helps you navigate a myriad of financial decisions via first-person accounts. Million Mile Secrets and The Points Guy each teach you how to travel for a fraction of the retail price using credit card rewards. These sites often link to other blogs, so you’ll discover more sites as you read.
Of course, we can’t help tooting our own horn in this category. Investopedia offers a wealth of free personal finance education. You might start with our special sections on budgeting, buying a home, and planning for retirement—or the thousands of other articles in our personal finance section.
You may need to visit your library in person to get a library card if you don’t already have one, but after that, you can check out personal finance audiobooks and e-books online without leaving home. Some of the following best sellers may be available from your local library: ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich,"" ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" ""Your Money or Your Life,"" and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Personal finance classics such as Personal Finance for Dummies,"" ""The Total Money Makeover,"" ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,"" and ""Think and Grow Rich"" are also available as audiobooks.
If you enjoy the structure of lessons and quizzes, try one of these free digital personal finance courses:
Personal finance podcasts are a great way to learn how to manage your money if you’re short on free time. While you’re getting ready in the morning, exercising, driving to work, running errands, or preparing for bed, you can listen to expert advice on becoming more financially secure. In addition to “The Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver,” you may find these valuable:
The most important thing is to find resources that work for your learning style and that you find interesting and engaging. If one blog, book, course, or podcast is dull or difficult to understand, keep trying until you find something that clicks.
Education shouldn’t stop once you learn the basics. The economy changes, and new financial tools like the budgeting apps mentioned earlier are always being developed. Find resources you enjoy and trust, and keep refining your money skills through retirement and beyond.
Personal finance education is a great idea for consumers, especially people starting out who want to learn investing basics or about credit management; however, understanding the basic concepts is not a guaranteed path to financial sense. Human nature can often derail the best intentions to achieve a perfect credit score or build a substantial retirement nest egg. These three key character traits can help you stay on track:
One of the most important tenets of personal finance is systematic saving. For example, say your net earnings are $60,000 per year, and your monthly living expenses—housing, food, transportation, and the like—amount to $3,200 per month.
There are choices to make surrounding your remaining $1,800 in monthly salary. Ideally, the first step is to establish an emergency fund or perhaps a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA).
Establishing an emergency fund takes financial discipline—without it, giving in to the temptation to spend rather than save can have dire consequences. In the event of an emergency, you may not have the money to pay the expenses—leading you to finance them through debt.
Once you have your emergency stash, you'll need to develop investing discipline—it’s not just for institutional money managers who make their living buying and selling stocks. Average retail investors tend to do better by setting an investment target and abiding by it rather than buying and selling stocks trying to time the market.
Timing can be crucial. For instance, imagine you're three years out of college, have established your emergency fund, and want to reward yourself. A Jet Ski costs $3,000, but you want to start investing also. ""Investing in growth stocks can wait another year,"" you say. ""I have plenty of time to launch an investment portfolio.""
However, putting off investing for one year can have significant consequences. The opportunity cost of buying a personal watercraft can be illustrated through the time value of money.
The $3,000 used to buy the Jet Ski would have amounted to nearly $49,000 in 40 years at 7% interest, a reasonable average annual return for a growth mutual fund over the long haul. Thus, delaying the decision to invest wisely may likewise delay the ability to reach your goal of retiring at age 65.
Doing tomorrow what you could do today also extends to debt payment. If you were to put the Jet Ski on your credit card, the $3,000 credit card balance would take 222 months (18.5 years) to pay off if you only made minimum payments of $75 each month. And don’t forget the interest you’re paying: at an 18% annual percentage rate (APR), it comes to $3,923 over those months. So, if you were to plunk down the $3,000 to pay the balance rather than let it compound, you'd see substantial savings—nearly $1,000.
Personal finance matters are business, and business should not be personal. A difficult but necessary facet of sound financial decision-making involves removing emotions from a transaction.
Making impulsive purchases feels good but can significantly impact long-term investment goals. So can making unwise loans to family members. Your cousin Fred, who has already burned your brother and sister, will likely not pay you back, either. The smart thing to do is decline his requests for help—you're trying to make ends meet also.
The key to prudent personal financial management is to separate feelings from reason. However, when loved ones are experiencing real trouble, it pays to help if you can—just try not to take it out of your investments and retirement.
The personal finance realm may have more guidelines and tips to follow than any other. Although these rules are good to know, everyone has their own circumstances. Here are some rules prudent people, especially young adults, are never supposed to break—but can break if necessary.
An ideal budget includes saving a portion of your paycheck every month for retirement—usually around 10% to 20%. However, while being fiscally responsible is important and thinking about your future is crucial, the general rule of saving a given amount for retirement may not always be the best choice, especially for young people just getting started.
For one thing, many young adults and students need to consider paying for their biggest expenses, such as a new car, home, or postsecondary education. Taking away 10% to 20% of available funds would be a definite setback in making those purchases.
Additionally, saving for retirement doesn’t make much sense if you have credit cards or interest-bearing loans to pay off. The 19% interest rate on your Visa card probably would negate the returns you get from your balanced mutual fund retirement portfolio five times over.
Finally, saving money to travel and experience new places and cultures can be especially rewarding for a young person who’s still unsure about their life path.
The rule of thumb for young investors is that they should have a long-term outlook and stick to a buy-and-hold philosophy. This rule is one of the easier ones to justify breaking. Adapting to changing markets can be the difference between making money or limiting your losses and sitting idly by and watching your hard-earned savings shrink. Short-term investing has its advantages at any age.
Common investing logic suggests that because young investors have such a long investment time horizon, they should be investing in higher-risk ventures; after all, they have the rest of their lives to recover from any losses that they may suffer; however, you don’t have to take on undue risk in your short- to medium-term investments if you don’t want to.
The idea of diversification is an important part of creating a strong investment portfolio; this includes both the riskiness of individual stocks and their intended investment horizon.
At the other end of the age spectrum, investors near and at retirement are encouraged to cut back to the safest investments—even though these may yield less than inflation—to preserve capital. Taking fewer risks is important as the number of years you have to earn money and recover from bad financial times dwindles, but at age 60 or 65, you could have 20, 30, or even more years to go. Some growth investments could still make sense for you.
Personal finance is managing your money to cover expenses and save for the future. It is a topic that covers a broad array of areas, including managing expenses and debt, how to save and invest, and how to plan for retirement. In addition, it can include ways to protect yourself with insurance, build wealth, and ensure wealth is passed on to the people you want it to pass to.
Understanding how to manage your finances is an important life-planning tool that can help set you up for a life without debt; you gain control of financial stresses and have a way to manage the expensive surprises that life can throw at you."

Here are the key steps to take.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100516/setting-financial-goals/,"Setting short-term financial goals, as well as mid-term and long-term, is an important step toward becoming financially secure. If you aren’t working toward anything specific, you’re likely to spend more than you should. You’ll then come up short when you need money for unexpected bills, not to mention when you want to retire. You might get stuck in a vicious cycle of credit card debt and feel like you never have enough cash to get properly insured, leaving you more vulnerable than you need to be to handle some of life’s major risks.
Even the most prudent person can't prepare against every crisis, as the world learned in the pandemic and many families learn every month. What thinking ahead does is give you a chance to work through things that could happen and do your best to prepare for them. This should be an ongoing process so you can shape your life and goals to fit the changes that will inevitably come.
Annual financial planning gives you an opportunity to formally review your goals, update them, and review your progress since last year. If you’ve never set goals before, take the opportunity to formulate them so you can get—or stay—on firm financial footing. Here are goals, from near-term to distant, that financial experts recommend setting to help you learn to live comfortably within your means, reduce your money troubles, and save for retirement.
Setting short-term financial goals gives you the foundation and the confidence boost that you'll need to achieve the bigger goals that take more time. These first steps can relatively easy to achieve in as little as a year: Create a budget and stick with it. Build an emergency fund. Pay down the credit card debt that's holding you back.
“You can’t know where you are going until you really know where you are right now. That means setting up a budget,” says Lauren Zangardi Haynes, a fiduciary and fee-only financial planner with Spark Financial Advisors in Richmond and Williamsburg, Virginia. “You might be shocked at how much money is slipping through the cracks each month.”
An easy way to track your spending is to use a free budgeting program like Mint. It will combine the information from all your accounts into one place so you can label each expense by category. You can also create a budget the old-fashioned way by going through your bank statements and bills from the past few months and categorizing each expense with a spreadsheet or on paper.
When you see how you are spending your money and you're guided by that information, you can make better decisions about where you want your money to go in the future. Is the enjoyment and convenience of eating out worth the extra money each month to you? If so, great—as long as you can afford it. If not, you’ve just discovered an easy way to save money every month. You can look for ways to spend less when you dine out, replace some restaurant/takeout meals with homemade ones, or have a combination of the two.
An emergency fund is money you set aside specifically to pay for unexpected expenses. To get started, $500 to $1,000 is a good goal. When you meet that goal, you’ll want to expand it so that your emergency fund can cover greater financial difficulties, such as unemployment. If you didn’t have an emergency fund prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, you likely wished you did. And if you did have one, you may have tapped into it and need to replenish it.
Ilene Davis, a certified financial planner (CFP) with Financial Independence Services in Cocoa, Florida, recommends saving at least three months' worth of expenses to cover your financial obligations and basic needs, but preferably six months' worth—especially if you are married and work for the same company your spouse does or if you work in an area with limited job prospects. She says finding at least one thing in your budget to cut back on can help fund your emergency savings.
Another way to build emergency savings is through decluttering and organizing, says Kevin Gallegos, vice president of sales and Phoenix operations with Freedom Financial Network, an online financial services company for consumer debt settlement, mortgage shopping, and personal loans. You can make extra money by selling unneeded items on eBay or Craigslist or holding a yard sale. Consider turning a hobby into part-time work from which you can devote the income to savings.
Zangardi Haynes recommends opening a savings account and setting up an automatic transfer for the amount you’ve determined you can save each month (using your budget) until you hit your emergency fund goal. “If you get a bonus, tax refund, or even an ‘extra’ monthly paycheck—which happens two months out of the year if you are paid biweekly—save that money as soon as it comes into your checking account. If you wait until the end of the month to transfer that money, the odds are high that it will get spent instead of saved,” she says.
Experts disagree on whether to pay off credit card debt or create an emergency fund first. Some say that you should create an emergency fund even if you still have credit card debt because, without an emergency fund, any unexpected expense will send you further into credit card debt. Others say you should pay off credit card debt first because the interest is so costly that it makes achieving any other financial goal much more difficult. Pick the philosophy that makes the most sense to you, or do a little of both at the same time.
As a strategy for paying off credit card debt, Davis recommends listing all your debts by interest rate from lowest to highest, then paying only the minimum on all but your highest-rate debt. Use any additional funds you have to make extra payments on your highest-rate card.
The method Davis describes is called the debt avalanche. Another method to consider is called the debt snowball. With the snowball method, you pay off your debts in order of smallest to largest, regardless of the interest rate. The idea is that the sense of accomplishment you get from paying off the smallest debt will give you the momentum to tackle the next-smallest debt, and so on until you’re debt-free.
Gallegos says debt negotiation or settlement is an option for those with $10,000 or more in unsecured debt (such as credit card debt) who can’t afford the required minimum payments. Companies that offer these services are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and work on the consumer’s behalf to cut debt by as much as 50% in exchange for a fee, typically a percentage of the total debt or a percentage of the amount of debt reduction, which the consumer should only pay after a successful negotiation.
1
 Consumers can get out of debt in two to four years this way, Gallegos says. The drawbacks are that debt settlement can hurt your credit score, and creditors can take legal action against consumers for unpaid accounts.
2
When you’ve created a budget, established an emergency fund, and paid off your credit card debt—or at least made a good dent in those three short-term goals—it’s time to start working toward midterm financial goals. These goals will create a bridge between your short- and long-term financial goals.
Do you have a spouse or children who depend on your income? If so, you need life insurance to provide for them in case you pass away prematurely. Term life insurance is the least complicated and least expensive type of life insurance and will meet most people’s insurance needs.
4
 An insurance broker can help you find the best price on a policy. Most term life insurance requires medical underwriting, and unless you are seriously ill, you can probably find at least one company that will offer you a policy.
Gallegos also says that you should have disability insurance in place to protect your income while you are working. “Most employers provide this coverage,” he says. “If they don’t, individuals can obtain it themselves until retirement age.”
Disability insurance will replace a portion of your income if you become seriously ill or injured to the point that you can’t work. It can provide a larger benefit than Social Security disability income, allowing you (and your family, if you have one) to live more comfortably than you otherwise will if you lose your ability to earn an income. There will be a waiting period between when you become unable to work and when your insurance benefits will start to pay out, which is another reason why having an emergency fund is so important.
Student loans are a major drag on many people’s monthly budgets. Lowering or getting rid of those payments can free up cash that will make it easier to save for retirement and meet your other goals. One strategy that can help you pay off your student loans is refinancing into a new loan with a lower interest rate. But beware: If you refinance federal student loans with a private lender, you may lose some of the benefits associated with federal student loans, such as income-based repayment, deferment, and forbearance, which can help if you fall on hard times.

﻿
Midterm goals can also include goals like buying a first home or, later on, a vacation home. Maybe you already have a home and want to upgrade it with a major renovation—or start saving for a larger place. Saving for college expenses or the costs that come with starting a family are other examples of midterm goals.
When you've set one or more of these goals, start figuring out how much you need to save to make a dent in reaching them. Visualizing the type of future you want is the first step toward achieving it.
The biggest long-term financial goal for most people is saving enough money to retire. The common rule of thumb is that you should save 10% to 15% of every paycheck in a tax-advantaged retirement account like a 401(k) or 403(b), if you have access to one, or a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. But to make sure you’re really saving enough, you need to figure out how much you'll actually need to retire.
Oscar Vives Ortiz, a CPA financial planner with PNC Wealth Management in the Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg, Florida, area, says you can do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate your retirement readiness:
If, for example, you started with a portfolio of $1 million and withdrew $40,000 in year one (4% of $1 million), then increased the withdrawal by the rate of inflation each subsequent year ($40,000 plus 2% in year two, or $40,800; $40,800 plus 2% in year three, or $41,616, and so on), you would have made it through any 30-year retirement without running out of money. “This is why you often see 4% as a rule of thumb when discussing retirement,” Vives Ortiz says.
“In most scenarios, you actually end up with more money at the end of 30 years using 4%, but in the worst of the worst, you would have run out of money in year 30,” he adds. “The only word of caution here is that just because 4% has survived every scenario in history does not guarantee it will continue to do so going forward.”
Ortiz provided the following example of how to estimate whether you’re on track to retire:
*For simplicity, we have not included the rate of return that would be earned over the next 10 years on the current investments.
For most people who have an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the employer will match a percentage of what you are paid, says CFP Vincent Oldre, founder of CFG Retirement in Minneapolis. They might match 3% or even 7% of your paycheck. You can get a 100% return on your investment if you contribute enough to get your full employer match, and this is the most important step to take to fund your retirement.
“What kills me is that people do not put money into their retirement plan because either they ‘can’t afford to’ or they are ‘afraid of the stock market.’ They miss out on what I call a ‘no-brainer’ return,” Oldre says.
Michael Cirelli, a financial advisor with SAI Financial in Warrenville, Illinois, recommends making IRA contributions at the beginning of the year as opposed to the end, when most people tend to do it, to give the money more time to grow and give yourself a larger amount to retire with.
You probably won’t make perfect, linear progress toward achieving any of your goals, but the important thing is to be consistent. If you are hit with an unexpected car repair or medical bill one month and can’t contribute to your emergency fund but have to take money out of it instead, don’t beat yourself up; That’s what the fund is there for. Just get back on track as soon as you can.
The same is true if you lose your job or get sick. You’ll have to create a new plan to get through that difficult period, and you may not be able to pay down debt or save for retirement during that time, but you can resume your original plan—or perhaps a revised version—when you come out on the other side.
That’s the beauty of annual financial planning: You can review and update your goals and monitor your progress in reaching them throughout life’s ups and downs. In the process, you will find that both the small things you do on a daily and monthly basis and the bigger things you do every year and over the decades will help you achieve your financial goals."
importance of emergency funds in financial stability,investopedia,The Ultimate Guide to Financial Literacy for Adults,"Investopedia rounds up the best educational content for students, teachers, and anyone else interested in learning personal finance and investing.",https://www.investopedia.com/guide-to-financial-literacy-4800530,"We know that the earlier you learn the basics of how money works, the more confident and successful you’ll be with your finances later in life. It’s never too late to start learning, but it pays to have a head start. The first steps into the world of money start with education.
Banking, budgeting, saving, credit, debt, and investing are the pillars that support most of the financial decisions that we’ll make in our lives. At Investopedia, we have more than 36,000 articles, terms, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and videos that explore these topics. We’ve spent 25 years building and improving our resources to help you make smart financial and investing decisions.
This guide is a great place to start, and today is a great day to do it. Let’s begin with financial literacy—what it is and how it can improve your life.
Financial literacy is the ability to understand and make use of a variety of financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. It also means comprehending certain financial principles and concepts, such as the time value of money, compound interest, managing debt, and financial planning.
Achieving financial literacy can help individuals to avoid making poor financial decisions. It can help them become self-sufficient and achieve financial stability. Key steps to attaining financial literacy include learning how to create a budget, track spending, pay off debt, and plan for retirement.
Educating yourself on these topics also involves learning how money works, setting and achieving financial goals, becoming aware of unethical/discriminatory financial practices, and managing financial challenges that life throws your way.
In its National Financial Capability Study the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that Americans with higher levels of financial literacy were more likely to make ends meet, spend less of their income, create a three-month emergency fund, and open a retirement account than those with lower financial literacy.
1
Making informed financial decisions is more important than ever. Take retirement planning. Many workers once relied on pension plans to fund their retirement lives, with the financial burden and decision-making for pension funds borne by the companies or governments that sponsored them.
Today, few workers get pensions; instead, some are offered the option of participating in a 401(k) plan. This involves decisions that employees themselves have to make about contribution levels and investment choices. Even contributing to a 401(k) may not be enough to afford a comfortable retirement. And those without employer options need to actively seek out and open individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
Add to this people’s increasing life spans (leading to longer retirements), Social Security benefits that barely support basic survival, complicated health or other insurance options, more complex savings and investment instruments to select from—and a plethora of choices from banks, credit unions, brokerage firms, credit card companies, and more.
It’s clear that financial literacy is a must for making thoughtful and informed decisions, avoiding unnecessary levels of debt, helping family members through these complex decisions, and having adequate income in retirement.
Personal finance is where financial literacy translates into individual financial decision-making. How do you manage your money? Which savings and investment vehicles are you using? Personal finance is about making and meeting your financial goals, whether you want to own a home, help other members of your family, save for your children’s college education, support causes that you care about, plan for retirement, or anything else.
Among other topics, it encompasses banking, budgeting, handling debt and credit, and investing. Let’s take a look at these basics to get you started.
A bank account is typically the first financial account that you’ll open. Bank accounts can hold and build the money you'll need for major purchases and life events. Here’s some background on bank accounts and why they are step one in creating a stable financial future.
Though the majority of Americans do have bank accounts, 6% of households in the United States still don’t have one.
2
 Why is it so important to open a bank account? Because it’s safer than holding cash. Assets held in a bank are harder to steal, and in the U.S., they’re generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
3
 That means you should always have access to your cash, even if every customer decides to withdraw their money at the same time.
Many financial transactions require you to have a bank account to:
When you think of a bank, you probably picture a building. This is called a brick-and-mortar bank. Many brick-and-mortar banks also allow you to open accounts and manage your money online.
Some banks are only online and have no physical buildings. These banks typically offer the same services as brick-and-mortar banks, aside from the ability to visit them in person.
Retail banks: This is the most common type of bank at which people have accounts. Retail banks are for-profit companies that offer checking and savings accounts, loans, credit cards, and insurance. Retail banks can have physical, in-person buildings that you can visit or they can be online only. Most offer both options. Banks’ online technology tends to be advanced, and they often have more locations and ATMs nationwide than credit unions do.
Credit unions: Credit unions provide savings and checking accounts, issue loans, and offer other financial products, just like banks do. However, they are not-for-profit organizations owned by their members. Credit unions tend to have lower fees and better interest rates on savings accounts and loans. Credit unions are sometimes known for providing more personalized customer service, though they usually have far fewer branches and ATMs.
There are three main types of bank accounts that the average person may want to open:
1. Savings account: A savings account is an interest-bearing deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution. Savings accounts typically pay a low interest rate, but their safety and reliability make them a sensible option for saving available cash for short-term needs.
They may have some legal limitations on how often you can withdraw money. However, they’re generally very flexible so they’re ideal for building an emergency fund, saving for a short-term goal like buying a car or going on vacation, or simply storing extra cash that you don’t need in your checking account.
2. Checking account: A checking account is also a deposit account at a bank or other financial institution that allows you to make deposits and withdrawals. Checking accounts are very liquid, meaning that they allow numerous withdrawals per month (as opposed to less liquid savings or investment accounts) though they earn little to no interest.
Money can be deposited at banks and ATMs, through direct deposit, or through another type of electronic transfer. Account holders can withdraw funds via banks and ATMs, by writing checks, or using debit cards linked to their accounts.
You may be able to find a checking account with no fees. Others have monthly and other charges (such as for overdrafts or using an out-of-network ATM) based on, for example, how much you keep in the account or whether there’s a direct deposit paycheck or automatic withdrawal mortgage payment connected to the account.
Lifeline and second-chance accounts, available at some banks, can help those who have difficulty qualifying for a traditional checking account.
3. High-yield savings account: A high-yield savings account usually pays a much higher rate of interest than a standard savings account. The tradeoff for earning more interest on your money is that high-yield accounts tend to require bigger initial deposits, larger minimum balances, and higher fees.
An emergency fund is not a specific type of bank account but can be any source of cash that you’ve saved to help you handle financial hardships like job losses, medical bills, or car repairs. Here's how they work:
You know them as the plastic cards that (almost) everyone carries in their wallets. Credit cards are accounts that let you borrow money from the credit card issuer and pay it back over time. For every month that you don’t pay back the money in full, you’ll be charged interest on your remaining balance. Note that some credit cards, called charge cards, require you to pay your balance in full each month. However, these are less common.
Here is the difference:
Debit cards take money directly out of your checking account. You can’t borrow money with debit cards, which means that you can’t spend more cash than you have in the bank. And debit cards don’t help you to build a credit history and credit rating.
Credit cards allow you to borrow money and do not pull cash from your bank account. This can be helpful for large, unexpected purchases. But carrying a balance every month—not paying back in full the money that you borrowed—means that you’ll owe interest to the credit card issuer. In fact, as of Q1 2024, Americans owed $1.12 trillion in credit card debt.

 So be very careful about spending more money than you have, because debt can build up quickly and become difficult to pay off.
On the other hand, using a credit card judiciously and paying your credit card bills on time helps you establish a credit history and a good credit rating. It’s important to build a good credit rating not only to qualify for the best credit cards but also because you will get more favorable interest rates on car loans, personal loans, and mortgages.
APR stands for annual percentage rate. This is the amount of interest that you’ll owe the credit card issuer on any unpaid balance. You’ll want to pay close attention to this number when you apply for a credit card. A higher number can cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars if you carry a large balance over time. The median APR today is nearly 25%, but your rate may be higher if you have bad credit. Interest rates also tend to vary by the type of credit card.
Credit scores have a big impact on your odds of getting approved for a credit card. Understanding what range your score falls into can help you narrow the options as you decide on the cards for which you may apply. Beyond your credit score, you’ll also need to decide which perks best suit your lifestyle and spending habits.
If you’ve never had a credit card before, or if you have bad credit, you’ll likely need to apply for either a secured credit card or a subprime credit card. By using one of these and paying back on time, you can raise your credit score and earn the right to credit at better rates.
If you have a fair to good credit score, you can choose from a variety of credit card types, such as:
Be aware of your protections under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). Research credit opportunities and available interest rates, and be sure that you are offered the best rates for your particular credit history and financial situation.
Creating a budget is one of the simplest and most effective ways to control your spending, saving, and investing. You can’t begin to improve your financial health if you don’t know where your money is going, so start tracking your expenses against your income. Then set clear goals.
Budgeting starts with tracking how much money you receive and spend every month. You can do this in an Excel sheet, on paper, or with a budgeting app. It’s up to you. However you decide to track, clearly lay out the following:
Subtract your total expenses from your total income to get the amount of money you have left at the end of the month. Now that you have a clear picture of money coming in, money going out, and money saved, you can identify which expenses you can cut back on, if necessary.
If you don’t already have one, put your extra money into an emergency fund until you’ve saved at least three to six months’ worth of expenses (in case of a job loss or other emergency). Don’t use this money for discretionary spending. The key is to keep it safe and grow it for times when your income decreases or stops.
Once you have enough savings to start investing, you’ll want to learn the basics of where and how to invest your money. Decide what to invest in and how much to invest by understanding the risks (and potential rewards) of different types of investments.
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where stock buying and selling takes place. The terms “stock market” and “stock exchange” can be used interchangeably. And even though it’s called a stock market, other financial securities, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate bonds, and derivatives based on stocks, commodities, currencies, and bonds, are also traded there. There are multiple stock trading venues. The leading stock exchanges in the U.S. include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and the Cboe Options Exchange.
To buy stocks, you need to use a broker. This is a professional person or digital platform whose job it is to handle the transaction for you. For new investors, there are three basic categories of brokers:
There’s no right answer for everyone. Which securities you buy, and how much you buy, will depend on the amount of money that you have available for investing and how much risk you’re willing to take to try to earn a higher return. Here are the most common securities to invest in, listed in descending order of risk:
Stocks: A stock (also known as “shares” or “equity”) is a type of investment that signifies partial ownership in the issuing company. This entitles the stockholder to a proportion of the corporation’s assets and earnings.
Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receive dividends (which come from the company’s profits) if and when they are distributed, and sell your shares to somebody else.
The price of a stock fluctuates throughout the day and can depend on many factors, including the company’s performance, the domestic economy, the global economy, the day’s news, and more. Stocks can rise in value, fall in value, or even become worthless, making them more volatile and potentially riskier than many other types of investments.
ETFs: An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, consists of a collection of securities, such as stocks. It often tracks an underlying index. ETFs can invest in any number of industry sectors or use various strategies.
Think of an ETF as a pie containing many different securities. When you buy shares of an ETF, you’re buying a slice of the pie, which contains slivers of the securities inside. This lets you purchase a variety of stocks at once, with the ease and convenience of only one purchase—the ETF.
In many ways, ETFs are similar to mutual funds. For instance, they both offer instant diversification and are professionally managed. However, ETFs are listed on exchanges and ETF shares trade throughout the day just like ordinary stocks.
Investing in ETFs is considered less risky than investing in individual stocks because there are many securities inside the ETF. If some of those securities fall in value, others may stay steady or rise in value.
Mutual funds: A mutual fund is a type of investment consisting of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds give small or individual investors access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios at a low price.
There are many categories of mutual funds, representing the kinds of securities in which they invest, their investment objectives, and the type of returns that they seek. Most employer-sponsored retirement plans invest in mutual funds.
Investing in shares of a mutual fund is different from investing in individual shares of stock because a mutual fund owns many different stocks (or other securities). Unlike stocks or ETFs that trade at varying prices throughout the day, mutual fund purchases and redemptions​ take place only at the end of each trading day and at a fund's net asset value (NAV). Similar to ETFs, mutual funds are considered less risky than stocks because of their diversification.
Bonds: Bonds are issued by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. When an investor buys a bond, they’re effectively lending their money to the bond issuer, with the promise of repayment plus interest. A bond’s coupon rate is the interest rate that the investor will earn.
A bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument because bonds traditionally have paid a fixed interest rate to investors, although some bonds pay variable interest rates. Bond prices inversely correlate with interest rates. When rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice versa. Bonds have maturity dates, which are the point in time when the principal amount must be paid back to the investor in full or the issuer will risk default.
Bonds are rated by how likely the issuer is to pay you back. Higher-rated bonds, known as investment-grade bonds, are viewed as safer and more stable. Such offerings are tied to publicly traded corporations and government entities that boast positive outlooks.
Investment grade bonds receive “AAA” to “BBB-” ratings from Standard and Poor’s and “Aaa” to “Baa3” ratings from Moody’s.

 Bonds with higher ratings will usually pay lower rates of interest than those with lower ratings. U.S. Treasury bonds are the most common AAA-rated bond securities.

importance of emergency funds in financial stability,investopedia,Financial Goals for Students: How and Why to Set Them,Setting financial goals can help students get a head start in life. Here are some of the best financial goals and how to set—and achieve—them.,https://www.investopedia.com/financial-goals-for-students-7151682,"With some background knowledge and financial education, a student can set up the groundwork for a successful financial future or even financial independence. Often, this right financial start requires a road map. Understanding how to set financial goals, and the types of goals to reach for, can help students create that road map and keep them on track.
Let’s take a look at financial goals, how to set them, and ways to increase the chances of success down the road.
A financial goal is a money objective that you hope to achieve. This might be to build a million-dollar nest egg or save enough for a week-long trip next year. Your financial goals can help guide you as you build up savings, decide to invest, or become debt free. Your financial goals are milestones on the road map to living the kind of life you want.
Setting financial goals early can help establish effective money habits that can provide you with a greater chance of achieving financial well-being later in life. Plus, the earlier you start setting goals like saving and investing, the more money you’re likely to have when it’s time to retire.
As you set financial goals, consider the three main types of goals, which can be broken down by time frame:
Be realistic about what you hope to accomplish and a potential time line.

When setting financial goals, Alissa Krasner Maizes, the founder of Amplify My Wealth, and a licensed attorney and registered investment advisor, suggests that you start with your values.
“Your list of what you value most can guide you in making the best decisions for you, making you more successful at reaching your goals,” Maizes says. “Next, decide what financial goals you want to achieve that align with your values, starting with smaller achievable and measurable goals that you can track, knowing you can always revisit and tweak them.”
Here are some potential goals for students.
Your budget helps you visualize your income and expenses. No mater how much money you have on hand to start with, outlining what you have, spend, and save (where applicable) is essential. You can use your budget to see how much money is coming in and list your most common costs.
“Creating a budget is an essential step toward financial stability,” Markia Brown, a Certified Financial Education Instructor and Registered Financial Associate at The Money Plug LLC, said. “It helps you track your income and expenses, prioritize your spending, and identify areas where you can cut back. It’s a short-term goal that you can achieve within a few hours or days.”
Brown suggests listing all sources of income and then reviewing your spending. Then, she recommends determining whether your expenses are needs or wants. This can help you determine what to cut back on when things get tight. It can also help you figure out how much money to direct toward other goals, such as paying off debt or saving for retirement.
“Review and adjust your budget regularly to reflect changes in your income and expenses,” Brown says.

Build a habit of saving now, and you’ll feel more comfortable with it later. Brown points out that many financial institutions will let you start an account with as little as $5 or $10. Set up recurring transfers so that money automatically goes into your savings account. Even $5 a week can help you start a good savings habit.
“Although opening a savings account is usually as easy as going online and entering your information, first consider whether you prefer a brick-and-mortar location near school,” Maizes said. “Consider the interest rate they will pay you for money in your account, or whether they have student accounts offering bonuses, fewer fees, no ATM fees, and lower minimums.”
Compare two to four choices and choose an account that works with your lifestyle.
No matter how much money you make, investing for retirement can be a major goal for you, according to Jeff DeMaso, Chartered Financial Analyst, a former portfolio manager, and editor and founder of The Independent Vanguard Adviser.
“Compounding may be the eighth wonder of the world, but it takes time to see the results,” DeMaso said. “So, you want to start investing as early as possible, even if you are starting out small.”
If you have an employer that offers a plan, such as a 401(k), have a portion of your paycheck deducted each period and set aside for the future. You can also open a roth individual retirement account (Roth IRA), Maizes points out. With this approach, you can take advantage of your current low tax rate to start building a nest egg for the future.  
DeMaso recommends looking for low-cost index funds and making sure you automatically invest, whether you’re using an employer-sponsored plan or opening your own account. Over time, as your income increases, boost the amount of money you set aside in your retirement account.
Maizes points out that an emergency fund can help you prepare to live independently, once you finish school. You might have help from your parents or some other source, such as scholarships and grants, to cover most costs. Once you graduate, though, dealing with unexpected costs can be more difficult.
Starting an emergency fund today can help you build over time. Similar to a savings account, an emergency fund can be started with just a few dollars. Consider setting a goal to eventually save at least six months’ worth of expenses. Start small, with perhaps $10 a week, and then increase as your income and financial situation improves.
“Your emergency fund is your safety net in the event you ever run out of money,” Maizes said. “An emergency fund is an excellent lifetime goal whether you are a student or not.”
Student loan debt can feel like a millstone when you graduate. Maizes suggests investigating scholarships and grants to reduce what you borrow.
“Consider applying for scholarships and grants that do not mandate you to pay back any money,” Maizes said. “These opportunities are open to students to apply for within and outside your school throughout your educational journey.”
If you go to a higher education institution, consult with your financial aid office and your academic department head to find out what’s available. Fill out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year to determine what aid you might qualify for.
You can also look for opportunities through federal work-study programs to earn money for expenses, rather than using student loan debt.

As a student and young adult, building credit as soon as you can is recommended.
“You’ll need a loan to buy a new car or house,” DeMaso said. “Your credit score will impact the interest rate you have to pay for those loans. So start building a good credit history now.”
One of the easiest ways to build credit is by getting and using a credit card. Choose one or two items to pay for with your credit card, and pay off the balance each month. Use your credit card as part of your regular spending plan, and make sure you only buy what you can afford.
DeMaso warns that the high interest rate charged by a credit card can hold you back. Use your card strategically so that you aren’t losing ground to debt.
Finally, even if you need some debt to accomplish your education goals, try to use as little as possible.
“Finding another way to make money towards your expenses can also go a long way, from tutoring, internships, dog walking, babysitting, and retail,” Maizes said.
Once you finish school, Maizes recommends putting together a debt repayment plan that can help you tackle any debt you have as quickly as possible. The most efficient approach is to order your debts from highest interest rate to lowest and put extra money toward the first debt while maintaining minimum payments on others. As you pay off each debt, you can add that extra payment to the next item on your list.
This might be a medium- to long-term goal, depending on how much debt you have and your ability to put extra money toward reducing your debt when you get your first job after graduation. However, you can still put some money toward other goals, even as you attempt to reduce your debt.
It’s never too early to have a plan for your money. In fact, establishing good financial habits now and learning how to set financial goals can help set you up for a better financial future. However, while it's important to set financial goals, creating a financial path for oneself does not guarantee a successful financial future, rather it's a stepping stone in the right direction.
As you set financial goals and work toward success, Maizes suggests celebrating your milestones and recognizing how far you’ve come.
“Whether you have extra money each month or not, celebrate being mindful of your money,” Maizes said. “This is a huge accomplishment. These steps will always serve you well and help you make better decisions with your money.”"
effective debt repayment techniques 2023,investopedia,The Effects of Fiscal Deficits on an Economy,Learn about the real impact of budget deficits on the economy and see why government financing reduces private financing.,https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021015/what-effect-fiscal-deficit-economy.asp,"Fiscal deficits arise whenever a government spends more money than it brings in during the fiscal year. This imbalance is common among global economies. Between 1970 and 2022, the U.S. government has had higher expenditures than revenues for all but four years.
1
 As of September 2023, the U.S. national deficit was $1.52 trillion.
2
Keynesian macroeconomics, named after British economist John Maynard Keynes, promotes spending to drive economic activity and stimulate a slumping economy by running large deficits.
3
The first American deficit plan was conceived and executed in 1789 by Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury.
4
 Hamilton saw deficits as a means of asserting government influence, similar to how war bonds helped Great Britain out-finance France during 18th-century conflicts.
5
Economists and policy analysts disagree about the impact of fiscal deficits on the economy. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has suggested that the sluggish recovery from the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 was attributable to the reluctance of Congress to run deficits to boost the economy.
6
Others argue that budget deficits crowd out private borrowing, manipulate capital structures and interest rates, decrease net exports, and lead to either higher taxes, higher inflation, or both.
Until the early 20th century, most economists and government advisers favored balanced budgets or budget surpluses. The Keynesian revolution advocated a countercyclical fiscal policy during periods of economic woe. During such times, the government uses deficit spending to make up for the decline in investment and boost consumer spending to stabilize aggregate demand.
3
Since 2001, the federal government budget has run a deficit each year. Some contributing factors include:
The long-term macroeconomic impacts of fiscal deficits are subject to debate. If the deficit arises due to short-term spending projects such as infrastructure spending or business grants, these sectors commonly see a boost in operations and profitability. If the deficit increases because receipts have fallen, either through tax cuts or a decline in business activity, this activity will not usually stimulate the economy.
Politicians and policymakers rely on fiscal deficits to expand popular policies, such as welfare programs and public works. Both conservative and liberal administrations tend to run deficits in the name of tax cuts, stimulus spending, welfare, public good, infrastructure, war financing, and environmental protection.
Some economists argue against government budget deficits for crowding out private borrowing and distorting interest rates. However, fiscal deficits have remained popular among government economists since Keynes legitimized them in the 1930s. Expansionary fiscal policy forms the basis of Keynesian anti-recession techniques and provides an economic justification for spending money with reduced short-term consequences.
Deficits are financed through the sale of government securities, such as Treasury bonds (T-bonds). Individuals, businesses, and other governments purchase bonds and lend money to the government with the promise of future repayment.
Government borrowing reduces the pool of available funds that can be invested in other businesses. An individual who lends $5,000 to the government cannot use that same $5,000 to purchase the stocks or bonds of a private company. All deficits tend to reduce the potential capital stock in the economy.
The sale of government securities has a direct impact on interest rates. The interest rate paid on loans to the government represents nearly risk-free investments against which all other financial instruments must compete. If the government bonds pay 2% interest, other financial assets must pay a rate to entice buyers away from government bonds. This function is used by the Federal Reserve when it engages in open market operations to adjust interest rates within the confines of monetary policy.
There are practical, legal, theoretical, and political limitations for debt on the government's balance sheet. The U.S. government cannot fund its deficits without attracting borrowers. Backed only by the full faith and credit of the federal government, U.S. bonds and Treasury bills (T-bills) are purchased by individuals, businesses, and other governments.
The Federal Reserve also purchases bonds as part of its monetary policy procedures.
13
 Should the government ever run out of willing borrowers, there is a genuine sense that deficits would be limited and default would occur.
Total government debt has real and negative long-term consequences. If interest payments on the debt become untenable through tax-and-borrow revenue streams, the government faces three options. It can cut spending and sell assets to make payments. It can print money to cover the shortfall, or the country can default on loan obligations.

While macroeconomic proposals under the Keynesian school argue that deficits are sometimes necessary to stimulate aggregate demand, some economists claim that deficits crowd out private borrowing, distort the marketplace, and unfairly burden future generations of taxpayers."
effective debt repayment techniques 2023,investopedia,Portfolio Investment: Definition and Asset Classes,"A portfolio investment is a stake in an asset bought with the expectation that it will provide income or grow in value, or both.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio-investment.asp,"Portfolio investment refers to acquiring and managing an array of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities, while balancing risk and maximizing returns over time. Yet, in a nation where the path to financial security and a stable retirement often winds through what for many is a pitfall-filled maze of investment choices, most Americans report being uncomfortable and unready to tackle their portfolio investments.
A 2024 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve paints a stark picture: most Americans in the lower 90% of income earners feel adrift when managing their investment portfolios. More alarming is that two-thirds of non-retirees say they're not on track in saving for retirement.
1
 These statistics aren't just numbers; they represent millions of individuals grappling with the stress and painful choices that come with an uncertain financial future.
As such, at a time when investment news often dominates headlines and resources on learning about stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and more are just a click away, for too many, managing portfolio investments remains a vague notion rather than a practical tool.
David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Strategic Financial Planning in Plano, Texas, said that with many financial products on offer from so many companies and given the profound changes in the financial markets over the past half century or so, it's not hard to see why portfolio investing might seem ""opaque"" to many. ""But in reality, today it’s easier than ever to put together a diversified, low-cost portfolio for any risk profile and time horizon,"" he said. ""Resources for investors of all experience levels abound. Knowledge is power, but you don’t have to become a financial prodigy to set yourself up for long-term success.""
Thus, learning the art of constructing and managing portfolio investments isn't just a skill for finance professionals; it's almost a necessity for anyone hoping to build long-term financial security, given the vast changeover since the early 1980s from defined pension plans to 401(k)s and the like for retirement planning.
As Tenerelli noted, you don't need to go it alone. ""Working with an advisor can help investors avoid pitfalls and approach optimization while integrating their investment planning with the rest of their financial situation, such as tax planning, estate planning, insurance/risk analysis, and so on."" Still, knowing how portfolio investing works is a benefit, whether you're a do-it-yourselfer or someone who feels better handing off your financials to professionals.
The ability to effectively choose investments for your portfolio can be the defining factor between a future marked by financial anxiety and one characterized by stability and relative comfort. As market complexities grow and traditional investment wisdom faces unprecedented challenges, understanding portfolio investment is critical and rewarding. Below, we'll explore the core principles of portfolio investment, clarify the main asset classes you'll be choosing from, and provide actionable insights from Tenerelli and others that can help you build and manage a portfolio that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance—no matter your financial experience.

Portfolio investment involves assembling a collection of financial assets with the goal of achieving specific financial goals while managing risk. This approach recognizes that different assets perform differently under various economic conditions, and some have greater risks with a greater potential for rewards than others.
Portfolio investments come from a range of asset classes, including stocks, government bonds, corporate bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and certificates of deposit. Your portfolio might also include more esoteric choices, including derivatives like options and futures or physical assets like real estate, commodities, and art and collectibles.
Here’s a closer look at the essential aspects of portfolio investment:
This is the process of determining how much of your portfolio to dedicate to each type of investment. This decision should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. For instance, a young professional saving for retirement might have a higher allocation to stocks for growth potential, while a retiree might lean more heavily toward bonds for income and stability.
2
Investment allocation styles for portfolio investments depend on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon. These styles typically range from conservative to aggressive, with many variations between:
Each style offers a different balance of potential risk and reward, allowing investors to align their portfolios with their individual financial circumstances and objectives.

Diversification is the cornerstone of portfolio investments. By spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographical regions, investors can cut the effect of any single asset’s poor performance on the portfolio. This strategy helps to mitigate risk and can lead to more stable returns.
4
""At a basic level, a diversified portfolio will probably include at least some stocks and some bonds,"" Tenerelli said. He advised those beginning with portfolio investments to look at ETFs and index or passive mutual funds, which are ""the easiest, lowest-cost way"" to assemble a portfolio that meets most people's needs. However, ""if investors wish to 'slice and dice' or 'tilt' their portfolio toward certain asset subclasses (such as small-cap value, emerging markets, etc.), or if they wish to invest in more esoteric asset classes such as derivatives or private equity, then more research is warranted.""
There are several approaches for diversifying a portfolio:
Portfolio investment involves continuously managing your risks to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. The primary tool for managing risk is diversification. This approach helps insulate the portfolio from the poor performance of any single investment or market sector.
Investors can further manage risk by regularly rebalancing their portfolios, ensuring that asset allocations remain aligned with their risk tolerance and goals despite market volatility.
Another key aspect of risk management is understanding and adjusting for your risk tolerance, which can change over time because of age, changes in finances, need for liquidity, and market conditions. This might involve gradually shifting to more conservative financial products as retirement approaches or adjusting strategies during periods of high market volatility. In addition, you can use tools like stop-loss orders to automatically sell assets if they fall below a certain price, or employ options strategies to hedge against potential losses.
10
Managing risk includes accounting for the risk-return trade-offs of each financial product. Generally, lower risk levels correspond to lower potential returns, while higher risk levels are associated with higher potential returns. Below is a chart representing the risk/return relationship with a higher risk typically related (but certainly not always) with higher potential rewards.
11


Investment horizons range from the short term—hours, days, weeks, etc.—to much longer spans, years and decades. For example, post-college professionals with a 401(k) plan would have an investment horizon of decades. Meanwhile, a day trader's horizon doesn't last beyond the trading today.
12
In general, portfolios that have a shorter time horizon should be those where investors are willing to take on less risk—such as when retirement is imminent. The longer the horizon, the greater the risks you can take since there's time for you to make up for shortfalls. Obviously, it isn't carte blanche to make the riskiest trades just because you have decades until retirement. Rather, a longer-term investor may hold what are considered riskier types of equities, such as mid-cap, small-cap, or high-growth stocks.
12
You'll need to decide whether you want to actively or passively engage with your portfolio investments. Active management involves buying and selling assets to outperform the market, often requiring extensive research and analysis. Meanwhile, passive management aims to replicate the performance of a specific index or benchmark, offering a cost-effective and lower-maintenance investment option. This can be quickly done by investing in a mutual fund or ETF that tracks an index of securities you want to follow, like the S&P 500 index. These are among the most popular funds to invest in.
For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is a passively managed fund for long-term investors that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index. The fund manager simply replicates the holdings by weight of the S&P 500's large-cap stocks.

These shouldn't be left for last. Often, the type and amount of assets you'll choose for your portfolio investments will depend in part on their tax efficiency, an essential aspect of portfolio investing. Different assets and accounts are subject to varying tax treatments, which can greatly impact your returns in the long run. Using tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize tax liabilities and increase your after-tax returns.
13


Asset classes are sets of investments that share similar characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. Here are the most commonly traded:
Equities represent ownership in a company and are typically traded on stock exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Investors can earn returns from equities in two primary ways: capital appreciation (increases in the stock price) and dividends (periodic payments to shareholders).
There are two main types of equities:
While generally considered riskier than other asset classes, stocks can deliver higher returns over the long term. Their performance is influenced by company performance, market conditions, and broader economic trends.
Fixed-income securities are investments that provide returns through regular interest payments and the return of principal at maturity. These securities have several features:
Bonds play a crucial role in many portfolio investments, providing income stability and often serving as a counterbalance to the higher volatility of stocks. However, investors should consider interest rate and credit risks, as well as the potential impact of inflation when incorporating bonds into portfolio investments.
Cash and cash equivalents form a crucial component of many portfolios, offering stability and liquidity. This asset class includes cash, bank deposits, money market funds, short-term government securities (e.g., Treasury bills), and highly liquid, short-term debt instruments.
These assets are characterized by their high liquidity, meaning they can be quickly converted to cash with little to no loss of value. They typically offer lower returns than stocks or bonds but provide a safety net and ready funds for immediate needs or investment prospects.
While cash and cash equivalents offer stability and liquidity, they don't necessarily keep pace with inflation over the long term. Holding onto these assets often results in a gradual erosion of purchasing power. Therefore, investors usually need to balance liquidity and safety with higher-yielding investments to achieve their long-term financial goals.
16
Alternative portfolio investments are a broad category for assets that fall outside the traditional list of stocks, bonds, and cash. Many alternative investments have low liquidity, meaning they can be difficult to buy or sell quickly. They are also often associated with higher potential returns but also higher risk and can require far greater kinds of knowledge or expertise.
Real estate investing involves buying, owning, managing, selling, or financing real estate properties to generate profit. Real estate investments fall into two main categories:
Real estate can generate income through rent and can appreciate in the long term. However, it also comes with risks such as market fluctuations. Property values and income are often greatly affected by changes in the overall economy, interest rates, and local market conditions. Maintenance costs, vacancies, and liquidity risks are all risks that come with investing in real estate.
Commodities are the oldest traded goods, typically raw materials or agricultural products traded either OTC or on exchanges like the Chicago Board of Trade. Common examples include precious metals (gold, silver, copper), energy resources (oil, natural gas), agricultural products (wheat, corn, livestock), and industrial metals (copper, aluminum).
These investments offer several features:
Investors can gain exposure to commodities through direct ownership (owning the physical goods), futures contracts (whose value is based on their expected value), commodity-linked ETFs and mutual funds, and shares in commodity-producing companies.
While commodities can offer portfolio diversification and potential inflation protection, they also come with unique risks, including storage costs for physical commodities, complex pricing, and high sensitivity to global economic and political events.

Besides real estate and commodities, lists of alternative portfolio investments typically include the following:
Suppose you have $100,000 to invest. You decide to build a diversified portfolio with the following asset allocation:
60% Stocks
35% Bonds
5% REIT shares
The portfolio is designed to provide exposure to various asset classes with different risk and return characteristics. The bulk goes to stocks for growth potential, with a significant portion in U.S. large-cap firms for stability. Bonds provide income and help mitigate overall portfolio risk, while REITs offer exposure to the real estate market.
The initial investment of $100,000 meets its target percentages. As the markets move, however, the portfolio investment allocations will shift. For example, if stocks have a strong year, the equity portion may grow to 65% of the portfolio.
To maintain the intended risk profile, you must periodically rebalance your portfolio by selling portions of the outperforming assets and using the proceeds to buy underperforming assets. This way, you can return the allocation to the original 60% stock / 35% bond / 5% REIT mix.
In the long term, you'll generate returns (or losses) that blend the returns of the individual asset classes. This diversification helps smooth out volatility compared with investing in one asset class or another.
Portfolio investments involve acquiring diverse financial assets to generate returns over time, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. By diversifying across different asset classes, investors can mitigate risk and potentially improve their returns, as various assets often respond differently to changing market conditions.
A key part of successful portfolio investing is understanding each asset class, including their risk profiles, liquidity, and correlations with one another. This allows you to build a balanced portfolio better tailored to your financial goals and risk tolerance. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio is essential to ensure it remains aligned with your goals while adapting to changes in your finances and the broader economic world. By following these principles, you can better position yourself for long-term portfolio investment success while addressing the inherent uncertainties of financial markets.

mindset shifts for improving financial health,investopedia,How To Achieve Financial Independence,"Before you can achieve financial independence, you have to figure out what it means to you. Here's how to set financial independence goals and achieve them, whether you want to retire early, live abroad, or reduce stress.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-achieve-financial-independence-8647093,"A growing number of women say that achieving financial independence is their No. 1 financial goal, according to a Fidelity Investments Survey. Fifty-eight percent of women surveyed said that they wanted to feel secure and not worry about money.
1
However, only 36% of respondents to REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's 2024 Her Money Mindset survey said that they held a retirement account, while only 71% said they held a savings account. And 54% said that they struggled to pay at least one major expense. 
Whether you're hoping to go full FIRE (financial independence, retire early) or just want to feel more on top of your expenses and planning, this guide will offer practical steps to get you where you want to go. 
“Financial independence means different things to different people,” says Walter Russell, an Ohio-based financial planner. “Some see it as (being) free from needing a regular job because they have money from other sources. Others think of it as not owing money to anyone, which makes them feel secure and in control.” 
Russell continues, “For some, it's about being prepared for retirement and knowing they'll be okay financially when they stop working. It can also mean having the freedom to start businesses or live wherever they want. It's all about feeling confident and in charge of your money and future.”
No matter your definition of financial independence, your end goal probably looks like freedom and autonomy. Your path to that destination will vary depending on your values, resources, and preferences.
At a basic level, financial independence means having sufficient income and savings to cover living expenses. If you're financially self-sufficient, you have the resources to fund cost of living. 
For Brock and Becky Waterman, better known as the FIRE Travel Family, financial independence meant pulling off a wedding on a shoestring budget, selling their home, and leveraging geographic arbitrage to live on less—even with three kids in tow. 
“[During COVID] I ran the numbers to see where we were, and we figured out if we sold our house and most of our [possessions] and our vehicles...we could go ahead and be financially independent and not have to work,"" says Brock Waterman. 
After cutting health care costs (almost $2,000 per month because the Watermans owned their own business), child care costs (almost $15,000 per year), and property taxes and insurance, the Watermans had reduced their expenses by more than half. 
Originally from Wisconsin, Waterman says that living in an RV and homeschooling their kids is an unconventional choice for his family. But they were motivated to spend more time with their kids; financial self-sufficiency helped them achieve their goal. 
While some people aim for financial independence by working for many years to amass significant savings, the Watermans chose to do the opposite and cut expenses in order to enjoy life now. Dividend-paying stocks, some savings, and a few certificates of deposit have sustained the family thus far, making their decision to travel the world with their kids a no-brainer.
Many associate financial independence with not needing traditional full-time employment or a paycheck. Passive income and dividend assets can help power financial independence plans.
“Investing 10-15% of gross income for retirement and putting another 20% of your after-tax income toward investing or other financial goals is a fantastic, back-of-the-envelope calculation for most people,” says Anna N’Jie-Konte, a certified financial planner and president of Re-Envision Wealth, when asked what steps she advises people to take to achieve financial independence.  
While some people can live on savings alone, most have to consider ways they could access cash fast if their circumstances change. Being self-employed or willing to work in a high-demand field as needs arise can make financial independence more accessible even without amassing much savings.
Most people think that financial independence requires a high net worth or large windfall. Konte says financial independence is achievable at lower income levels, too.
“Many financial planning studies show that in some respects it's actually easier to reach financial independence when you are middle-income because Social Security makes up a greater percentage of your retirement income need, therefore you need to save less of a nest egg on your own,” she says.
Brock Waterman agrees. He encourages people aiming for financial independence not to focus on a target savings or investing number. “When we worked for ourselves, we were paying a little over $2,000 a month, so $24,000 a year, for health care,” he says. 
After Becky Waterman closed her massage business and he stopped working, they were able to access subsidized health care because they make less annual income. Brock Waterman estimates that they paid $3,000 or $4,000 for premiums the first year. This year, he says, the family paid only a few hundred dollars on health care.  
Three years into financial independence, he encourages people to take the leap if they really want it, rather than waiting to hit a specific set number goal.
Whether it is fear of an emergency or ambitions to send kids and grandkids to college, long-term security can keep people locked into income-generating jobs that they don’t love. But financial security is just as much about what you want to spend your money on as it is about what you don’t.
For example, the Watermans decided against saving for four-year college educations for their kids. Instead, their long-term vision includes setting aside $10,000 to $15,000 per kid to invest in their vocational training, skills building, or launching their own business. 
“They'll have the money for community college, and if they decide they want to go to a four-year college, that's going to be something they're going to have to make a decision for themselves,” Waterman explains. 
Russell adds that discipline in saving, investing, and living below one's means plays a more significant role regardless of income level. 
“Focus on increasing the savings rate and maximizing investment returns through strategic allocation,” he advises. “High-income earners should avoid lifestyle inflation and prioritize long-term wealth accumulation through prudent financial management and investment strategies.” 
Those building blocks of financial discipline ensure financial independence for the long haul.
While financial independence serves everyone, research shows it holds special significance for women, who typically earn less than men, live longer, and have greater caregiving responsibilities.
According to 2022 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, women employed full-time and year-round had median earnings of $52,360, while the median earnings for men employed full-time and year-round were $62,350.
2
While progress has been made over time in closing this gender wage gap, the disparities between the earnings of men and women persist. 
The latest data from The World Bank shows that in 2021,  life expectancy at birth was 79 years for women
3
 in the United States and 74 years for men.
4
 This represents a 5-year difference, with women having a higher life expectancy compared to men. Yet lower wages and long stints without income due to child rearing and caregiving put women at risk of having less cash during their golden years. 
According to estimates from Fidelity Investments, the average 65-year-old woman can expect to spend about $157,500 more on medical bills throughout retirement than the average 65-year-old man.
5
 Longer female life expectancies correlate with a need for larger retirement savings and income to cover additional years of living expenses and health care costs.
“With added responsibility comes additional costs and cash flow pressure,” Konte adds. Women disproportionately shoulder unpaid caregiving duties for children and adult dependents.
A 2023 MetLife study found that most caregivers are women, and women providing care to a parent lose as much as $120,000 in lifetime wages due to working fewer hours. If a woman leaves the workforce entirely to provide care, the study found the lost wages rise to around $142,000.
6
 Caregiving for kids, spouses, and parents contributes to career impediments, lower savings, and higher out-of-pocket care expenses for women than men.
Research from AARP shows that Latinx and Black caregivers spend higher percentages of their income on care expenses than white caregivers.
7
 So, whether it's earning power, longevity, or caregiving norms, women encounter unique financial challenges that make financial independence difficult to achieve but even more meaningful for disrupting cycles of inequality. 
Achieving financial freedom rests on embracing an intentional money mindset, goal-focused strategies, and smart financial behaviors over time. It's a lifestyle shift rather than a quick fix. Here are 10 key steps that are an important part of any financial independence journey.
Defining your ""why"" gives meaning and motivation to stay disciplined while working toward your unique vision of financial freedom. Whatever your answer, revisit this when you need inspiration to stick to the path.
Gaining clarity around your current financial situation identifies opportunities for improvement and savings needed to reach independence.
To assess your current financial situation: 
Once you have a clear understanding of your income and expenses, it's time to calculate your assets and liabilities. Your assets include any savings accounts, investment portfolios, and property values. On the other hand, your liabilities encompass all forms of debt, such as credit card balances, student loans, and mortgages.
To calculate your net worth, subtract total liabilities from total assets. This formula provides a snapshot of your current financial health and can serve as a baseline for setting future financial goals. Understanding your tax scenarios is also crucial, as this can influence your investment strategies and overall financial planning.
Doing a thorough assessment may uncover excess spending that could be saved or invested to reach financial independence sooner. This intelligence becomes the baseline to set goals against and track progress over time.
Although the Watermans discourage it, many people start their financial independence journey by coming up with a number—an ideal savings, investing, or net worth number that would make them feel that full-time work was truly optional. Quantifying your number motivates saving and investing decisions.
To determine this:
Although the future remains unpredictable, having an estimate keeps your financial behaviors aligned with your target.
“For individuals aspiring to achieve financial independence through investing, several fundamental principles can guide their journey,” says Russell. Starting early and investing consistently harnesses the power of compounding returns over time.” 
Diversify investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk and improve long-term growth. “Rebalancing the portfolio periodically ensures alignment with financial goals and risk tolerance. Continual education about investing strategies and market dynamics empowers individuals to make informed decisions and adapt to changing circumstances on their path to financial independence,” he adds.
He says investing may require the help of a team—a financial advisor, a tax strategist, and an attorney—whose expertise can help you achieve financial independence even sooner.
Some definitions of financial independence entail being completely debt-free. But, for some people, debt doesn’t derail the dream. 
“Achieving financial independence while maintaining debt is possible but requires strategic management and prudent decision-making,” says Russell. He says it's essential to differentiate between “good” debt, such as mortgages or student loans, and ""bad"" debt, like high-interest credit card debt. 
Russell says, “Prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debt while leveraging low-interest debt strategically can be a viable approach. However, minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can enhance financial security and accelerate the journey to independence.”
To create a repayment strategy, there are two popular options: the debt snowball and the debt avalanche methods:
Debt Snowball: Pay minimums on all debt while putting any extra funds toward the smallest balance first. Once the first debt is cleared, roll its minimum toward the next smallest, and so on until all are repaid.
Momentum builds as small wins pile up. This mental boost keeps you tackling larger debts.
Debt Avalanche: With this method, arrange debts by interest rate instead of size. Make minimum payments on all while targeting extra funds at the debt with the highest interest rate first.
Paying down high rates saves money on expensive financing charges over time. However, it may take longer to see progress.
Choose the approach that best fits your financial personality and needs. The main thing is sticking to the repayment plan until you're debt-free.
Life happens. You never know when you'll be hit with unexpected home repairs, job losses, or health issues. Having accessible cash reserves prevents resorting to high-interest debt when surprises hit.
Set up automatic monthly transfers to hit the target amount in an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured account, preferably a high-yield savings account that you can easily tap.
9
 Once you meet your emergency savings target, redirect automated flows toward investing instead. 
Your most valuable financial asset remains human capital. Your ability to earn over your working years through high-income skills can make financial independence even easier to achieve. Pursue education (even financial and investing education), as well as consulting or freelancing opportunities that allow you to boost your income on your terms.
Carving out time for professional development keeps your skillset marketable, even if you never choose to work again. 
As you expand skills and connections, create diversified income channels versus relying solely on salaries and wages:
Mixing multiple income sources protects against disruption and risk while compounding overall cash flow.
Big wins also come from the cost side of your cash flow equation. Small cost savings add up. The Watermans believe in frugality, not because they’re penny pinchers but because they are intentional about what they pay for.
“You can be very ruthless … don't spend money if it's not important to you,” says Brock Waterman. Ask yourself if every expenditure moves you toward independence goals and greater life satisfaction. Does buying another pair of shoes bring lasting value? Or does a trip create deeper connections? 
For the Watermans, traveling isn’t a luxury. It’s part of their financial independence plan. Traveling to low-cost-of-living areas means they spend money on memorable adventures while world-schooling their kids. Intentional spending aligns with the deeper “why” and prevents lifestyle creep from diluting bigger life plans.
Reaching financial independence requires lifelong learning and growth. Mastering money mechanics, investing nuances, and tax optimization strategies greatly accelerate your outcomes over decades.
Read personal finance books, listen to financial independence podcasts, attend investment seminars, and join money-minded online communities. Surround yourself with like-minded people who will teach you new, useful skillsets, rather than discourage you from reaching for your goals. 
Also, work with a financial advisor—a fiduciary who crafts a holistic plan for you. Their expertise navigates optimized outcomes not possible alone. Investment pros protect wealth too —steering you away from emotional decision pitfalls novice investors succumb to.
The first step to achieving financial independence is defining what it means for you. True independence requires a shift to intentional money mindsets and habits over time. There’s more than one way to do this.
“I think it's important for folks to work toward multiple financial goals at once,” advises Konte. “In my opinion, retirement investing should be a nonnegotiable that we are always working toward regardless of our other financial goals. The amount will vary depending on your cash flow needs, but we should always try to do both.” 
Russell reiterates that “while a high income can expedite financial independence, it's not a prerequisite.” Smart and consistent money management, even with the assistance of a skilled team of advisors, can unlock financial independence for some families.
Each money milestone compounds into greater agency to determine how you spend your time. Financial independence tends to deliver time and geographic independence too, which offers value well beyond dollars and cents.

mindset shifts for improving financial health,investopedia,The Financial Advisor Profession Still Lacks Diversity,The financial advisory industry remains overwhelmingly white and male but efforts to recruit minorities and women are slowly bearing fruit.,https://www.investopedia.com/financial-advisor/fa-profession-accountable-lack-diversity/,"In a nation at times grappling with, at others neglecting, persistent income disparities across gender, ethnic, and racial lines, the demographics of financial advisors starkly reflect these broader economic inequalities.
The financial planning industry has always been overwhelmingly white and male, and for some time industry leaders have known that a more inclusive approach to hiring could gain them more clients among women and minorities. Yet, industry data still raises important questions about representation, access, and trust in financial services. Below, we'll dig into the implications for clients and the industry.
The disparities among financial advisors, still about 80% white, may be unsurprising given the well-documented income gaps and low representation of women and minorities in fields related to economics and mathematics.
1
 Careers that blend ""wealth management"" with a quantitative background, such as financial advising, perhaps inevitably mirror these broader societal disparities.
However, that could lead some to shrug their shoulders, point to structural factors, and dismiss the need to address long-term problems in a profession that was 95% white into the early 2000s. Linda Friedman, a civil rights attorney at Stowell and Friedman Ltd., who has handled cases resulting in hundreds of millions in settlements in the industry, parroted what she said is a standard industry response to questions about industry demographics: ""It's not our fault. It's society's fault,"" she told NPR's ""Planet Money"" in 2023. ""We're in the business of making money. And so we look for customers who have money, and it's not our fault if there's a wealth disparity in this country.""
2
That response would fail to explain why other financial service professions are more diverse, even as those have been under investigation by Congress and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for a lack of diversity for years—a telling sign if the numbers for financial advising are worse.
3
4
5
Worse than offering the view that nothing is to be done because the issues are societal would be to perpetuate these inequalities. Taking women as an example, a quick review of not-long-ago industry articles would reveal a 2006 Journal of Financial Planning piece titled ""How to Help Older Divorcing Women Avoid the Bag Lady Blues,"" which has a first sentence that improbably claims millions of women were yelling, ""I don't want to be a bag lady!"" across the U.S.—an image that at once makes a cartoon of homelessness and the plight of gender inequality. Other problematic articles of the period depicted ""the dynamics of women"" (as if they were a monolith) as ""frozen in headlights,"" with the male authors downplaying the extensive social scientific literature on gender-based income inequality as merely an outcome of time off from work ""due to pregnancy, child care, and caregiving.""
6
7


It was thus no surprise that news articles more than two decades ago were premised on an ""urgent need for greater diversity"" among financial advisors. ""Our profession is very late in coming to grips with the need to increase diversity,"" said Connie Chen, a certified financial planner (CFP) and former president of the International Association for Financial Planning, in a 2002 article.
8
 Given the current demographic data, we hear similar refrains in recent years. This distressing historical echo suggests a stubborn lack of progress despite a long-standing awareness of the problem.

As of 2024, Hispanic or Latino CFPs accounted for only 3.1% of the industry total, with Asian or Pacific Islanders and Black planners at 4.2% and 2.0%, respectively. The chart below tabulates the data for CFPs, as well as personal financial advisors overall, who show slightly more diversity, though the numbers still fall well short of representative of the U.S. population.
1
Kimberly Foss, founder and president of Empyrion Wealth Management in Roseville, California, told Investopedia that the lack of diversity in the financial services industry is a central issue for the sector to face because it skews practices and norms away from the realities of the larger society.
“If we want a body of professionals who can understand and empathize with a changing American society and culture,” Foss said, recruiting underrepresented groups in far greater numbers is critical.
There are other changes afoot in the financial industry, suggesting a time of job growth when such changes are more workable given the hiring slots available:
There's been a significant rise in non-retirement investing among nonwhite adults, according to a 2024 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) report, ""Investors of Color in the United States.""
14
 Since 2015, there has been a 9% increase in the number of Black investors, a 6% increase among Hispanic or Latino investors, and a 7% point increase among Asian or Pacific Islander investors. By contrast, the percentage of white investors remained relatively stable during this period.
These new investors of color tend to be younger, with almost half of Black (49%) and Hispanic/Latino (45%) investors under 35 years old, compared with only 28% of white investors. The FINRA study shows that Black and Hispanic or Latino investors generally have smaller non-retirement portfolios, with the majority (59% for both groups) holding less than $50,000 in investments, compared with only about a third of white investors. In addition, about half of Black and 38% of Hispanic or Latino investors have less than two years of investing experience, while almost six in 10 white investors have been investing for 10 years or more.
In short, there is a greater need among these demographics for financial advisors.
Chloe McKenzie, founder and CEO of BlackFem, Inc., a nonprofit focused on creating opportunities for women and girls of color, told Investopedia that the industry has a problem that feeds on itself. Women and underrepresented groups are more reluctant to seek professional financial advice because they can’t readily find advisors they identify with. Meanwhile, a mistrust of the industry keeps women and racial minorities from entering the field to serve the groups who could directly benefit from their advice.
15
2
14
“The lack of diversity is hugely problematic for women and minorities seeking financial advice for a multitude of reasons, the two most prominent being comfort and respect,” Winkfield said. “Because of the boys’ club, a members-only power structure, and the inherent issues that come with it, those who do not belong in looks or gender are often intimidated or uncomfortable with their advisor options when seeking advice.”

FINRA's 2024 report and similar studies find a longstanding distrust among women and people of color toward financial professionals. ""First, they're not in our neighborhoods, with the perception that we don't have the capital, we don't have the money to invest,"" a Black male focus group participant told FINRA researchers. ""And there's also the perception from us that you need thousands of dollars to even do business with them,""
14
This has led to frustration within different communities about a lack of representation in the financial advisory industry. Janna Hurd, a market developer at Thrivent, pointed out the meager percentage of Black financial planners and advisors. ""That means Black Americans are having some of their most important conversations with professionals who don't share a similar background,"" she wrote in a 2024 Financial Planning piece.
16


This can stifle their ability to grow wealth, potentially widening the wealth gap. ""Advisors are ... there for some of life's milestones, such as buying a home, having a baby, or entering retirement,"" Hurd wrote. ""Because this client-financial advisor relationship is so much more than a series of professional transactions, the right fit has to be there as well—and for many in the Black community, that fit can be hard to see across the table.""
The disparities are also detrimental to the advisory industry itself.
“When people aren’t able to find an advisor they connect with, they get discouraged and procrastinate or start looking elsewhere for guidance,” Ande Frazier, former vice president of distribution at Penn Mutual, told Investopedia. “They’re turning to robo-advisors, the internet, or their family members and friends for advice, therefore discounting the important role of the advisor.”
The scarcity of financial advisors from diverse backgrounds has far-reaching consequences for people of color and women, researchers argue.
15
 First, trust and empathy are key to working with financial advisors. ""If clients don’t believe they can trust you to be transparent or keep their conversations and financial details confidential, they will never do business with you. It’s really that simple,"" Valerie R. Leonard,
17
 one of Investopedia's top 100 financial advisors and CEO of EverThrive Financial Group in Birmingham, Alabama, told Investopedia about the need for trust in financial advising relationships.

A recent study of 3,500 middle-income Black women found 60% had difficulty in finding financial professionals or advisors they believed they could trust.
18
 In addition, underrepresentation contributes to a cycle of financial disparity and missed opportunities for wealth building.
""I didn't grow up with somebody teaching me how to save, teaching me how to invest,"" a Hispanic female told FINRA. ""So, to have somebody to teach me—who understands that I have zero experience with where to begin—would be helpful because it's less stigmatized, I guess, and I don't have to feel stupid asking questions.""

McKenzie, the founder of BlackFem, said these perceptions of the industry are impacting recruiting within financial advising. “I think a lot of women, people of color, and women of color are not going into the industry because there’s such a large amount of distrust of the financial sector from communities of color and from women,” she said.
Addressing this underrepresentation is crucial not just for equity but for the financial health of entire communities.
19
 As the financial landscape becomes increasingly complex, it's perhaps natural that many discussions in the industry circle around AI, cryptocurrencies, and other leading-edge issues in advising. However, the number interested in such investments is actually relatively small—about only 2% of Americans in 2023 used crypto to send money or buy something—especially when compared with those underserved by the financial advising community.
20
The financial advisory industry has faced many discrimination lawsuits in recent years, highlighting ongoing issues of racial and gender inequality. These cases have not only resulted in substantial settlements but have also shed light on the personal experiences of advisors in such circumstances.
Felicia Slaton-Young, a former Edward Jones advisor, participated in a case that resulted in a $34 million settlement in 2021. ""I didn't walk into this thinking I would walk away rich; I walked in wanting to prove that my experience wasn't a fallacy or dream,"" Slaton-Young told NPR. ""I needed to fight for my dignity back.""
2
Slaton-Young underscored the emotional toll of workplace discrimination beyond the financial implications. Other notable high-profile cases include the following:
While these and many other settlements in recent years have resulted in payouts in the hundreds of millions, the companies typically admit no wrongdoing as part of these agreements. This pattern of large settlements without formal admissions of guilt leaves an ambiguous message for the industry, as if discrimination lawsuits are among the costs of doing business.
Recent trends show a shift in women's engagement with investing and financial planning. Despite many positive economy-wide changes, significant challenges remain, particularly in the representation of women as financial advisors.
According to the 2024 Her Money Mindset Survey from Investopedia and REAL SIMPLE, women are increasingly taking charge of their finances. The survey found that 58% of women feel somewhat or very confident in their ability to make sound financial decisions, with this confidence increasing with age and income. In addition, 60% of women make financial decisions independently, while 40% share decision-making with someone else.
However, the survey also revealed that only 39% of women hold investments. This figure varies significantly based on age, income, and financial literacy. Women who make more than $75,000 annually are more likely to invest (58%) and hold multiple investments.
The challenges women face in the industry are not just about representation but also the workplace culture. While women have advanced in financial advising, it's been slower in some parts of the sector than in others. Personal financial advisors are about 31% women, while CFPs are still less than a quarter female. Other estimates put the total of all financial advisors at only about one in five.
28
""I have been discriminated against not only for being a woman but also for being a mother in this industry,"" Kassi M. Fetters, a CFP at Artica Financial Services in Anchorage, Alaska, told Investopedia. ""I have been the only person at a firm who had a child. No other employee had any children. I have been accused of having ‘mommy brain’ [and] have been humiliated when walked in on while breast pumping in my closed office.""
Fetters suggested this lack of representation could be creating a disconnect between advisors and female clients, potentially impacting women's—especially mothers'—comfort levels with investing and financial planning. Here are other likely outcomes of the gender imbalance in financial advising:
Despite these challenges, there are positive signs. The survey found that women are actively seeking financial knowledge, with 39% looking for financial information at least monthly. This rate is even higher (48%) for millennials and younger women.
“As women, it is crucial for us to talk more about money and investing,"" Leonard said. ""We must have empowering conversations with one another that will help bridge the gender gap and encourage our friends and the next generation to get smarter with money.”
As the industry evolves, it's clear that increasing the representation of women in financial advising isn't just about equality but simply about providing better, more comprehensive financial services that cater to the needs of each investor.

 among the top 10 of the Investopedia 100 Top Financial Advisors, is the founder of Sofia Financial in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, which focuses on women 45 and over. She notes that this demographic controls a growing amount of wealth in the country. Nevertheless, the women she serves ""are overlooked and devalued in many areas of society and culture, and yet we are the ones who will continue to control a growing amount of the wealth in this country,"" McCullough said. ""To serve women well, we have to have a wider conversation that encompasses all the things in our lives that are touched by money. So we have to talk with our clients about their careers and what in life brings them fulfillment, about their families and relationships, about what makes them feel happy and secure.""
For her part, Fetters said, ""I still truly believe it is possible to have a career in the financial industry and raise a family as a female, but there is still a lot to overcome.""

Industry leaders and organizations have put in place many different strategies to attract and retain diverse talent, focusing on education, mentorship, and inclusive recruiting practices.
31
5
 Despite those efforts, recent legal and political developments have created significant new challenges.
In recent years, the financial services industry has seen a notable shift in its approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, largely in response to a changing political climate and high-profile court cases. This includes the Supreme Court's decision to ban race-based affirmative action in college admissions, which has had a ripple effect across various sectors, including major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase curtailing or retooling their diversity programs.
32
33
In addition, suits are becoming common that target programs specifically for raising up women and minorities as a form of ""reverse discrimination."" In May 2024, Citigroup was sued for alleged racial discrimination because of its policy of waiving ATM fees for customers of minority-owned banks.
34
 Meanwhile, the SEC, Nasdaq, and other major industry players are under significant scrutiny in the courts for their inclusion programs, including rules requiring board diversity disclosures.
35
36
These legal challenges and setbacks are forcing the financial industry to reassess its approach to diversity and inclusion. While some companies are scaling back their initiatives in response to legal pressures, others are seeking to promote diversity in ways that can withstand legal scrutiny.
Meanwhile, there's been a transition toward focusing on grassroots efforts and long-term strategies to build a more diverse talent pipeline and financial advising clientele from the ground up rather than relying solely on top-down diversity programs. Previous strategies have been too often up to the whims of changing corporate boards, trends, and U.S. court decisions.
Foss, the founder of Empyrion Wealth Management, said there's still a need for better and more effective mentorship programs and recruiting practices. These should target the interests and cultures of racial minorities and women. She said that an early emphasis on financial education can also boost a career in the financial services industry, so it's on the radar for women and people of color.
“We should be developing outreach programs targeting high school students, who need to know that ours is not only a viable industry but crucial for the long-term well-being of the general population,” Foss said. At the college level, expanded internship opportunities may prove critical in attracting more women and underrepresented people to the industry.
Winkfield said the challenge with these programs is ensuring they create a comfortable environment for the people they’re trying to recruit.
This is something McKenzie’s organization has focused on. Education initiatives are the focal point of BlackFem, which advances financial literacy through programs offered in elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as online workshops for parents. “We’re culturally responsive and infuse the experiences of those that we serve into our curriculum, and to top it off, we look like the constituency we serve,” McKenzie said.
These efforts can attract the interest of women and underrepresented people to advisory careers, but the financial industry must also play a part in attracting the groups that it wants to hire. Retaining diverse talent is as crucial as recruiting it. This means implementing flexible work policies, providing diversity and inclusion training, and establishing employee resource groups.
Winkfield said that encouraging diversity hinges on more than just rules and programs. Financial advising firms need to adopt a more inclusive mindset: “It’s human to gravitate toward like-looking and like-minded people, and it takes a conscious effort to seek out diversity when it’s not your normal.”

The financial advisor industry continues to grapple with a significant lack of diversity, despite increased awareness and efforts to address the issue. Recent data shows that while there has been some progress, the representation of women and people of color in the industry remains disproportionately low.
This lack of diversity not only reflects broader societal inequalities but also has far-reaching consequences for clients, particularly those from underrepresented groups. The absence of diverse advisors can lead to missed opportunities for tailored financial advice, perpetuate the wealth gap, and create a disconnect between advisors and clients from different backgrounds."
mindset shifts for improving financial health,investopedia,The New Age of Financial Literacy with Kyla Scanlon,"In episode 81 of the Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver, we talk to Kyla Scanlon, a writer, investor, researcher, and financial influencer.",https://www.investopedia.com/the-express-podcast-episode-81-5225441,"Outside of the stock market, consumers are feeling the ripple effects of rising rates. Mortgage rates on the 30-year fixed hit 4.8%. The median U.S. household now needs 34.2% of gross income to make that monthly payment, up from 29% a year ago. A five-year loan on a new car is 4.2%. That's up from 3.6% in January. And average credit card APR are ticking up as well, hitting 16.4% last week on average. That's up a little bit from January. Back inside the capital markets, the first quarter was a tough time to be a balance and diversified investor. A 60/40 portfolio, 60 stocks, 40 bonds, was down 5.3% in the first quarter. That's the bad news. The good news, according to Ryan Detrick at LPL Finance, the past five times it was down 5% or more saw pretty strong gains the following quarter. Could that be a sign of a bottoming and stabilization for U.S. markets?
Here are a couple of other reasons it could be a lot worse for equity investors. Real yields on government bonds are still negative. Real yields are what investors receive on U.S. government bonds after accounting for inflation. Despite the steep rise in Treasury yields this year, so-called real interest rates are still fairly low. For now, that is providing support for the economy and an incentive for investors to keep seeking returns in riskier assets. The yield on the five year Treasury inflation-protected securities, a benchmark gauge of real interest rates over the next half decade, clocked in at a -0.6%, according to Tradeweb. That was up from about -1.6% at the end of last year, but still well below the 1% level it reached in 2018.

Some of the smartest, most engaging content about finance and investing is happening away from traditional media outlets, don't act so surprised. We do our best around here. But over the past few years, several important new voices have emerged around the financial media bubble, and they are building large followings organically. You've heard from many of them on the Express before: Earn Your Leisure, The Wallstreet Trapper, Morgan Housel.
Well, Kyla Scanlon is another rising star in that galaxy, but she didn't just get here. She's been trading and blogging for years, but she's expanded her content platforms on Instagram, TikTok, her podcast, and her Substack, where she has hundreds of thousands of followers. You want to learn about Roblox and the creator economy? Follow Kyla. You want to understand the Fed and interest rates in a way that actually matters to the way you live. Follow Kyla. You want to know about the meaning of the metaverse? You know what to do, follow Kyla. And you know what we did? We brought Kyla onto the Express all the way from beautiful Denver, Colorado. Welcome, Kyla. So good to have you here. 
Kyla:
""Yeah. Thanks so much for having me. Super happy to be here.""
Caleb:
""Well, let's start at the very beginning (or close to it). You've been trading options and you were trading options since you were a teenager. What got you into options and how did you learn and what were your first days like when you got into the options trading universe?""
Kyla:
""So, for me, it was just something that I could do over the summer. I just really wanted to explore that because I didn't know a whole lot about money, and it seemed like a cool thing to do. So, I used tastytrade.com, and I went through a learning course and was able to trade through my broker by going through this course, right? Because you're not supposed to trade under a certain age.""
""And so, that's what I did, and I was really bad at it. Just absolutely horrendous. But I learned a lot through doing a little bit of money at it and just trying to figure out how the market worked. And so, that was my first foray into the financial universe, which I don't really recommend that people do, sort of backwards like that. But it was definitely an interesting learning experience.""
Caleb:
""Yeah, you just jumped right over equities, right over index funds and ETFs. You didn't tiptoe your way in, you jumped into the hottest part of the frying pan to do that. Were you a math person? What was it about options that got you so interested?""
Kyla:
""I mean, it was just more about like the mechanics of it. My dad would talk about it a little bit. He was kind of... dads are sort of sometimes into that kind of stuff. And so, I was like, 'This seems like a cool thing to learn about,' and I really was fascinated by it. I was never like a math brain kid. I was always a reader and a big writer. So, it wasn't that I was drawn to it because of the pure mathematics behind it but definitely found that part fascinating too."" 
Caleb:
""Well, you started blogging about your trading, which really set the foundation for all the content you're producing today. How would you describe what you do today? What do you do?""

Kyla:
""So, I mean, I guess like a brief background on the blog: I started that back in college. So, a blog on options trading, it was called Scanlon on Stocks. And I wrote for Seeking Alpha in college and sort of had to stop all that once I worked for Capital Group after I graduated school, but kept up the blog in the meantime.""
""So now, how I describe what I do is... sort of a synthesizer, a curator. I don't really like saying 'content creator,' which I think is how most people would describe me. But I have a Substack that I publish once a week, and I talk about everything from wheat prices to oil prices to the Fed's decisions. And then I have a daily TikTok where I try to break down different concepts around, like, the yield curve or what Brainard spoke about—one of the members of the Federal Reserve. And then I also have a YouTube channel where I do longer-form videos on the stock market. And then I also do a lot of different things on Twitter, on Instagram and then TikTok. So, just try to be everywhere. I have a podcast as well. That's basically my clipped audio.""
""The main goal is just to help more people understand what's going on in the financial universe and to break it down in such an interesting way, or hopefully interesting way, hopefully unique way because I feel like there's not enough art made about finance, and hopefully that's something that I'm helping to to fill the gap in.""
Caleb:
""Hey, man, we're birds of a feather there. I'm an art major who turned into the editor in chief of Investopedia, so I got no business being here either, but I try to do some storytelling around it. So, you're a puzzle solver also. You're curious. What piques your curiosity these days about investor behavior, especially over the past year or so? It's been a very strange time.""
Kyla:
""How much time do you have? I feel like we could talk forever about all the weird stuff that's happening. I think the meme stocks are really interesting to me, and especially now that they're upticking again. I found this safe-haven thesis around meme stocks, where people seem to be going towards them in times of uncertainty because they're like, 'These seem safe and good,' and that's a really confusing to me. I don't quite understand the whole GME, AMC interest. So, I think that's something that's interesting.""
""And then also just how the stock market is responding to this broader uncertainty narrative. It seems like everything the Fed says the stock market is like... and it needs to go up. And so the big question for me is, is there a bubble? And is the bubble going to pop or is it just kind of chug along like this for the next little bit?""
Caleb:
""Let's talk about consumers because I know you write a lot about them. U.S. consumers, since you and I are among them... Americans love to spend, Kyla, you know that. We've been doing a pretty good job of it, even amid raging inflation. As a market and economic philosopher, if you will, what is it about our spending resiliency that fascinates you?""
Kyla:
""I think a lot of people try to compare this to 2008, and I do think that you have a different consumer. Wage growth hasn't matched inflation, right? But most consumers theoretically are better off than they were previously. So, I think that people are pretty resilient, as you said, right now. You see people spending on cruises, they're still planning on vacations. There doesn't seem to be a big pullback in the amount of spending that the consumer is doing.""
""And I think, broadly speaking, the consumer is relatively healthy. You see that in the applications for houses, even though those applications have gone down because mortgage rates have gone up. But you do see better creditworthiness from housing applicants. So, I think that consumers are just out there to spend. I'm not sure if... this is something I've also been thinking about: is it a sense of financial nihilism, where it's kind of like, 'I just have to spend money and this is just how it is?' Or do consumers actually have this excess savings? The savings rate has declined, but it's not terrible. People are doing relatively OK, but are they doing super OK? I don't think so.""
Caleb:
""I don't either. I do think there are some revenge spending going on out there. You can't deny that. I'm guilty of it as well.""
Kyla:
""What I have noticed that people really like to have nice things. I think that we have this sort of like showy, social media society. And if you want to keep up with the Joneses, and literally everybody is the Joneses right now, you kind of have to spend because we're just so chronically online. So, I think that that's a driving force of that as well.""
Caleb:
""Guilty as charged as well. I know I've done some of that too, but these sometimes do not end very well. Kyla, we're in April, which is Financial Literacy Month around these parts. Although at Investopedia, and on your blog and on your TikTok, it's always Financial Literacy Month, but you've written about how we need to pare down financial literacy and improve it, not expand it. What's wrong with financial literacy today? What are you doing to try to change it?""
Kyla:
""I think it is Simon... that said this is about financial literacy, that maybe we should think about what we can make better versus trying to add more things to it. So, the way that I think about it is it has to be almost entertaining. And that's not the best thing ever to say because our brains already melting because of TikTok. But I think that you have to make stuff a little bit more engaging, and you have to make it applicable.""
""So, the way that I think about it is, 'If I can get people to pay attention,' and the way that you get people to pay attention is by making fun of something or memeifying it a little bit, then you can send them down a rabbit hole. So, my goal right now is to be a little bit more top of funnel for people. And then if they show interest in different concepts, hopefully they'll look that stuff up. Ideally, as I continue to build out my own financial education concept and company, the goal would be to sort of take... not necessarily gamify it, but just think about how we can have people apply these concepts into things that they already know about, right? So, how can you sort of build your financial model of the world in your head relative to things that you already do?""
""So, everybody goes and spends money at Starbucks or Costco or whatever. And I think if people were able to see the path of how the money that they spend at Starbucks or Costco sort of reverberates down the Costco & Starbucks supply chains... So, you spend money on a coffee, that coffee was made with beans, that money pays a worker, the money pays for the beans, and then all of that goes up into corporate headquarters, all that stuff. I think that we need to do more visualization around the systems that we exist in because everybody is an economic entity.""
""And I think that the biggest issue with financial literacy is that we oftentimes treat people as like, 'Oh, this is something that's separate than you and is optional for you to learn about.' But really, you're part of it, right? And so, I think we just have to make people feel more welcomed, and the way that you can do that is be like, 'Hey, you're you're doing it. You're already doing it. Just... here's some extra knowledge about what you are already doing.'""
Caleb:
""You're a market participant or you're an economic participant, whether you know it or not. And the two key things people don't like talking about, as you know, Kyla: their health and their money. But those are kind of the two things that stress us out the most or that can have the biggest impact on our life. So, I love what you're doing. I can't wait to see what you're building. You started trading options at a pretty young age. You jumped right into the hot part of the frying pan, as I said. What attracted you to options and what have you learned by trading that has helped you in other aspects of your life?""
Kyla:
""Yeah. I mean, I think for me it was just confusing. So, grew up in Kentucky, I was fascinated by the idea of getting out of Kentucky. Figured that if I understood the concept of money that, ideally, I could sort of build a path out of there. And with options, I was more fascinated by what it meant relative to the Greeks and things like that. So, 'What does a delta mean? What does a gamma mean? How does all of that work?'""
""There's so much mechanical math sometimes behind finance that's... and finance, like a stock, you can sometimes see it as something that like doesn't make sense. Like, why is Tesla going up? Who knows? But like Tesla's options market is so much more mechanical, and it like makes so much more sense because it has to. So, I think what was sort of interesting to me was the how it all interacted. The ecosystem of the options market was really, really fascinating.""
Caleb:
""We just wrapped up our Financial Literacy Survey, we've put it out there for folks to see. One of the things it shows, Kyla, is that 30% of Gen Z and millennials own cryptocurrency, and a large percentage of them are counting on crypto to help fund their retirement, and they're planning on retiring younger than older generations now. This is a big generalization. It's a big survey that we did. But what's your reaction to that?""
Kyla:
""Wow. I mean, no, that's great. I own crypto. Huge fan of crypto in some aspects. Definitely have qualms with it too, which I think it's healthy to not have a balanced take on things like that. But that's good. I think that Gen Z, which I'm like an older Gen Z... I think that it's good that they're interested in crypto because it's going to be the future of something, right? I think it has a big part of how we think about future interactions, the future of money. I do think that if the Fed ever figures out the CBDC situation, that would be really beneficial. And I think that there's a lot that they can learn from the crypto universe from that.""
""With regards to retiring, that's something I have a little bit of a thing with because I think a lot of people see crypto as a way to get rich quick, which sure, a lot of people have. But I also think that is not the healthiest mindset to have with certain things. And that might sound preachy, but I just think that if you're going into something to try and make a lot of money off of it, you oftentimes miss the beauty of it. And then if you don't get rich, you get frustrated, and then you just end up like washing your hands entirely of the situation. So, not the biggest fan of that concept. I'm not sure if that's what they meant. But I do think it's very exciting that there's interest and people are purchasing crypto.""
Caleb:
""There's a lot of interest. It's one of our most popular subjects here at Investopedia, we get questions about it all the time, and we're constantly learning about it too. But I don't disagree with you. In some form or another, digital currency is our future. And maybe the Fed here needs to take a field trip over to El Salvador and see how things are going there now that they made it legal tender. So, it's so fascinating. Which investors, Kyla, or economists or financial influencers influence you?""
Kyla:

""A lot of people! A lot of people on Twitter I've just learn so much from. I was having a conversation, which is crazy, with the Odd Lots podcast. So, Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal, and we were just chatting a little bit in the comments on Twitter, and they're a huge influence to me. I think they do a great job breaking down macroeconomic concepts, and they're always so on the ball with like everything that they talk about, and I just learned a ton from them.""
""And then Corey Hoffstein, I think that's how you say his last name. He's really great. Then Ben, who specializes in volatility. The whole indie ETF crew... The guys over at ETF Exchange. All those people, I learned a ton from. The Roundhill crew. I mean, there's so many people. And then fellow finance creators, I learned a ton from Kayla Kilbride... and Dan Toomey. We all have like a little group chat where we talk about stuff. And so, that's really helpful. And yeah, but I would say Twitter is where I learn the most, and then I am able to have a lot of different threads going on there. Not in terms of who I'm talking to, but just different people that I read, so I can't even name them all. So, I'm so lucky because of that. There's so many people, which is which is great.""
Caleb:
""Yeah, I hear you. And folks, we're going to list some of those folks in the show notes here, but I follow some of the same people, and I'll tell you what, Twitter takes its knocks for some things. One thing it's really good at is connecting the financial community. The FinTwit community is amazing. That's how Kyle and I know each other, and that's how I know a lot of the friends that I've met over the years. So, valuable. Kyla, let's do a lightning round. Three questions, quick questions. Ten second responses each, shoot right from the hip. No time to think. I'm just going to blast you, and you blast right back. Are you ready?""
Kyla:
""Yeah, I hope so!""
Caleb:
""Me too. Elon Musk and Twitter. Ten-second reaction.""
Kyla:
""Oh, that's... he refiled his form. That SCC division of Elon Musk I'm sure is super happy with them right now.""
Caleb:
""I think you're absolutely right. He and the SCC just love each other. They're getting together for the holidays. I can't wait to be there for that. AMC Entertainment buys a gold mine. Your reaction?""
Kyla:
""Berkshire Hathaway of meme stocks.""
Caleb:
""Great one. And I will be with the Berkshire Hathaway crew in early May for their annual meeting. We're going to want to talk to them about that as well. OK, last one. Since you mentioned Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger?
Kyla:
""They keep on going. I'm impressed. Longevity.""
Caleb:
""Absolutely. Longevity in their 90s, still doing the thing and doesn't seem like they're ever going to slow down. I'm looking forward to seeing them next month. All right, Kyla, you know that we are a site built on our investing terms. So many people come to us to learn about those terms and find definitions for stuff. What's your favorite investing term and why? What's the one that speaks to your soul?""
Kyla:
""Oh gosh, I mean, right? The first thing that came to mind immediately, it was inflation, right? So, decline in purchasing power. I think that's a misunderstood one almost. and it's so important. I think that there was a survey that came out saying that that's the thing that people worry the most about. And I think that a lot of people don't even fundamentally understand what it means. So that's probably my favorite definition, and I go to the Investopedia page a lot to read about it. So, yeah, that's my favorite one.""
Caleb:
""You're the one. Thanks for coming by there. We appreciate that.""
Kyla:
""I'm the clicks, yeah!""
Caleb:

""That's a lot of clicks. you must be on that page a lot, so we appreciate that. But I hear you, that is term of the moment right now. In our latest Sentiment Survey, that is issue number one, concern number one. And a lot of the other things that are going on are contributing to inflation. So, no matter what, you can't get away from it. Such a pleasure to meet you, Kyla Scanlon. Folks, follow her, kylascan on TikTok, Kyla Scanlan everywhere else, on Instagram, on Twitter. Check out the Substack, there are so many interesting articles and things to read about there. I just kept going through it and kept finding things that piqued my interest. Really good to meet you, and thanks so much for joining the Express.""
Kyla:
""Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.""
It's terminology time. Time for us to get smart with the investing term we need to know this week. And this week's term comes to us from Pat in Chillicothe, Illinois, right there on the Illinois River in lovely Peoria County. Pat suggests Treasury inflation-protected bonds or securities. We like to call them TIPS around here. TIPS are a type of Treasury securities issued by the U.S. government. TIPS are indexed to inflation in order to protect investors from a decline in the purchasing power of their money. As inflation rises, rather than their yields increasing, TIPS instead adjust in price the principal amount in order to maintain their real value.
Heading into 2022, funds focused on Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, as we call them, were among the top performing asset classes as worries about inflation surged. Then, as the Federal Reserve shifted into inflation fighting mode, those fears began to fade and TIPS performance cooled down too. But then Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy and other commodity prices soaring. That drove investors back into TIPS to offset losses elsewhere in the bond market. Since February 10, the average inflation-protected bond has risen 1.2%, while the average intermediate core bond fund has fallen nearly 4%. TIPS generally outperform normal Treasury securities when inflation is trending higher than expected. If inflation starts to cool, given rising interest rates, TIPS should follow. Good suggestion, Pat. We're sending you some silky smooth Investopedia socks for your next walk along the Illinois River."

Budgeting and saving money don't come naturally to many people for obvious reasons. Spending money on nonessentials is so easy, even if you're committed to a well-laid spending plan.

Still, getting on track with a realistic budget and squirreling money away may not be as difficult as you think. Begin by taking the time to create a budget, which can help you reorganize your finances, prioritize spending, and manage debt, thus allowing you to make progress toward your long-term financial goals.

Make a Classic Budget

Budgeting your money is the cornerstone of a sound financial plan, and seeing all of the numbers in black and white can offer valuable perspective on where your money is going and where you could put it to better use.

A budget can help you spot areas where you're spending more than you realize. It can also be set up to allow for the occasional indulgence as well as unforeseen emergencies. You have lots of reasons to set aside a few hours to build a classic budget, especially when you can do it in four practically painless steps.

Gather into one place all of your electronic or paper bills, receipts, pay stubs, bank statements and any other record of income or expenses for at least a month. Or keep track of monthly income and expenditures as they happen.
Create a budget worksheet, using a budget template from Google Sheets, an Excel spreadsheet, or paper and pen. List all of your income after taxes—for example, employee and freelance income, investment income, and interest earned on any savings accounts. Then list all expenses—for example, rent or mortgage payments, credit card payments, installment loan payments, grocery receipts and utility bills.
Add up each set of figures, and subtract the expense total from the income total to get a general picture of your financial health. If your income total is larger than your expense total—congratulations—you just found more money for saving, investing and paying down your debt. If your expense total is larger than your income total, all is not lost, but you'll have to make some choices about where you spend some of your money going forward if you want to balance your budget.
Drill down into your expenses and further categorize them into fixed, variable and discretionary expenses. Fixed expenses (such as your rent) remain the same from month to month and thus often constitute the basis of your budget. Variable expenses, such as utility bills, can typically be lowered with behavioral tweaks like turning off the lights as you leave a room, and discretionary expenses consist of wants rather than needs and provide the most opportunities for saving.
Adopt the 50-20-30 Approach

You have alternatives if you don't want to make a classic budget. For example, you could consider structuring your plan according to the 50-20-30 rule. Under this approach to budgeting, you spend:

50% of your after-tax income on housing, food, and other necessities
20% on paying down debt or increasing savings
30% on whatever you want—discretionary spending

Although this plan is simple, some critics say that it allows too much discretionary spending and doesn't emphasize debt reduction or savings enough.

Use Apps

Another alternative to a classic budget is a budget app that can be downloaded to your phone, tablet, or computer. You generally link your app of choice to your checking and credit card accounts, and the app tracks your spending and generates a monthly report by spending category.

Budget apps can often be set up to alert you when a payment is coming due, when an account balance is getting too low, or if there's suspicious activity in your account. The cost of most apps ranges from zero to several dollars a month, although some offer free introductory periods so that you can try before you buy.

Put Your Budget to Work

Once you figure out how much money you're spending and where you're in a better position, take the necessary steps to put your financial future front and center.

Reduce Spending

Start by cutting spending on items you don't need. For example, do you need a $5 coffee every morning? Could you make do with a smaller, older car? Instead of an expensive vacation, would you be willing to try a stay-at-home vacation (""staycation"")?

These types of choices are very personal, so there's no right or wrong answer. But laying them out on the table can at least help you understand your priorities and some of the options you might not have realized you had for saving money.

Get a Handle on Your Debt

One aspect that seems to come with adulthood is accumulating some form of debt. Credit cards, student loans, car loans and mortgage payments are common types of debt. Credit cards and other forms of debt can be an essential part of your financial toolbox because they build your credit history, but you should exercise care when using them. Understanding the difference between good debt and bad debt can go a long way toward making sure you use credit wisely and maintain a good credit history.

At the same time, you should always look for ways to make your debt less expensive while you're paying it off. Transferring your credit card balances to a card with a 0% APR or refinancing your student loans, for example, could reduce the amount you pay in interest charges and accelerate your debt payoff plans.

To build wealth, you have to start somewhere. The ability to save money is essential, but the first step in saving is spending less than you earn. This point may seem obvious, but it's often more easily said than done. Fortunately, even if your budget doesn't allow much wiggle room, dozens of ways to save money are available.

Reduce Your Tax Burden

Nobody likes paying taxes, but they're an important aspect of any financial plan. Even if you don't make much money, you might be surprised to learn how certain tax strategies and decisions can affect your finances.

Learning how to minimize the impact of taxes on your finances can ensure that more money is going into your pocket and moving you toward your financial goals. Tax planning includes claiming all of the deductions and tax credits you're eligible for, and maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, such as an employer's 401(k) plan, an IRA, or a Health Savings Account (HSA), as often as possible.

Set Up Automatic Savings

One of the best and most convenient paths toward wealth accumulation is to sign up for automatic savings. Open a savings account, and then link your checking account to it so that an affordable, fixed amount is automatically transferred into your savings account every month.

Shop Smart and Live Frugally

Plan weekly menus and meal-prepping around inexpensive, nutritious foods, and draw your shopping list directly from these menus. Try to avoid running to the store multiple times a week by designating one day a week as your shopping day. When that day rolls around, take your list to a local discount market, and stick to the list.

Clip paper coupons to redeem at grocery stores, drugstores, restaurants, and more, or try using one of the many available coupon apps to take page flipping and scissors out of the equation.

Shop for clothes, furniture, and toys at garage sales, thrift stores, and vintage shops, but spring for new mattresses, upholstered furniture, swimsuits, underwear, bike helmets, shoes, and the like. Never buy these latter types of items used.

Attempt to spend money only when it's really necessary. For example, use your local library for books instead of cluttering up your space with expensive tomes that you'll probably only read once, if at all.

Spend Money To Save Money

This advice may sound like an oxymoron, but many real-life examples can point the way to you saving some serious bucks. For example, take your car in for scheduled maintenance, and don't skip your six-month dental cleaning and checkup. These preventive strategies may be painful to your pocket, but deferring maintenance—whether for yourself personally or on items you own—could lead to a lot more pain and expenses down the road.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the purpose of a budget?

Budgeting helps you to make a plan for your financial life and track how well you're sticking to that plan. Instead of wondering where your money went at the end of the month, you can make a proactive plan for how you want to use it to attain financial freedom and independence rather than getting trapped in debt.

How do I stick to a budget?

People have trouble sticking to their budgets for a variety of reasons, so getting on track will depend on your particular struggles. It could be that your budget is unrealistic or that your budgeting process is too cumbersome, or it could be that you need motivators to help you improve your self-control. Try to figure out where the problem lies so you can address it with the appropriate solution.

How do you budget money on a low income?

Many budgeting principles apply regardless of your income level. However, a lower income can present challenges for fitting all of the essentials in. As usual, the place to start is to review all of your expenses and compare them to your income. Then, you can begin making decisions about where to cut spending. If you're still having trouble making the budget work, you may want to explore additional ways to bring money in. Finally, if you're struggling to make ends meet, consider options for rental assistance, help with utilities, or debt counseling.

MOMO PRODUCTIONS / GETTY IMAGES

In times of economic uncertainty, employers need to consider that some employees can’t just rely on benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. Many workers may be looking for more immediate help to cover emergencies and expenses they otherwise can’t manage.

According to Pew Research Center, fewer than one in four lower-income workers in the U.S. have enough extra funds to cover three months of expenses, let alone those that are unexpected.1 With that said, people who had emergency funds might’ve exhausted them by now to make ends meet during recent trying times. This lack of emergency funds can have an impact on people’s ability to take care of some of their most basic expenses. For example, 15% of adult renters were not caught up on rent as of March 2021, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).2

Some employers are addressing these concerns by creating emergency savings plans—accounts that can be funded with automatic deposits through payroll deductions to help pay for critical costs like housing, food, and transportation.

Here’s why these employer-sponsored emergency funds could be essential, and how your company may be able to assist you in times of need.

How an Employer-Sponsored Emergency Savings Plan Works

Employer-sponsored emergency savings plans exist in a few different forms, but they all serve the same purpose: Giving employees access to a liquid account when they need immediate cash. 

For instance, in October 2020, shipping company UPS partnered with financial nonprofit Commonwealth to introduce an emergency fund plan for its 90,000 non-union workers.3 This plan is similar to a retirement account, where employees contribute a percentage of their pay through payroll deductions. 

Note

If your employer offers a savings account or plan, check to see if it also offers contribution matching. This perk might be more attractive to those employees who wouldn’t otherwise contribute to an emergency fund, while also helping to beef up their balances. 

There are a few common employer-sponsored emergency savings plans that your company may offer. You could have an in-plan option, where your employer offers an account that supplements your retirement plan, but is used to help prevent you from dipping into your retirement savings early. Another option may be a separate program through a bank or credit union that allows you to save money.

After-tax employee 401(k) accounts: Employers and workers could make after-tax contributions to an emergency fund that’s administered by the same group that runs the company’s 401(k). While earnings are taxed and subject to penalties upon withdrawal, your after-tax contributions are not, making that money more liquid than your pre-tax 401(k) contributions. 
Deemed Roth IRAs under a 401(k) plan: This works similar to a 401(k) account but earnings are withdrawn tax-free because with Roth plans, you are contributing after-tax dollars, though earnings may still be subject to taxes and penalties.
Depository institution accounts: Some companies may not offer retirement plans, but can encourage emergency savings through depository accounts—savings plans at banks or credit unions that are easily accessible and FDIC-insured.4

If you were to leave the company, the type of account could determine how you get that money. For instance, money in a retirement 401(k) might get rolled over into an individual retirement account (IRA). On the other hand, with an employer-sponsored emergency savings account, money in a depository institution might mean you just need to transfer that money to a different account outside of what the company established. 

Note

If you want to set up a plan at your company, talk to your human resources (HR) department about options and what could work best for employees. You may also need to consult your current retirement plan sponsor to see if they have any options as well.

Some of the questions you may want to ask HR and plan sponsors include: 

What’s the maximum threshold for savings? 
Is there a company match? 
Can you set up automatic payroll deductions?
How do you access the money in the account? 

You can also use the Compliance Assistance Statement of Terms (CAST) template provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for some general guidelines.

Pros and Cons of Employer-Sponsored Emergency Savings Plans
Pros
Fast funds, less penalties
Option for companies without retirement plans
Waived fees and charges
Cons
No guarantee of employer matching contribution
Less money for the long term
Additional employer expense
Pros Explained
Fast Funds, Less Penalties

Giving workers quick access to a savings or other type of easily accessible account can be crucial to their financial well-being. Savings accounts may help deter employees from tapping into retirement savings in times of need. Even if you did choose to withdraw funds early from your retirement plan to cover expenses, it may take several weeks for you to actually get that money and it could come with taxes and penalties that ultimately reduce the amount you receive.5 In times of an economic crisis or downturn, people need money right away without penalties.

Option for Companies Without Retirement Plans

Employers that don’t offer retirement plans can still offer emergency savings plans by opening accounts at banks or other financial institutions. This could give you quick access to funds without the red tape of a 401(k) or similar retirement plan.

Waived Fees and Charges

Some people may skip opening traditional savings accounts for fear of not meeting minimum saving or deposit requirements. An employer-sponsored savings plan may cover the fees and charges that you would otherwise have to pay.

Note

Employer-sponsored emergency savings accounts could also help reduce employee stress and lead to increased productivity.

Cons Explained
No Guarantee of Employer Matching Contributions

While workers contributing to their own savings plans are important, employers matching contributions means workers can double their deposits. These incentives could increase employee participation in plans they might not otherwise get involved in. However, while you might have the opportunity to contribute to a savings account through work, there’s still the chance that your employer doesn’t offer matching contributions.

Less Money for the Long Term 

For low and moderate earners who are already struggling to save for retirement, putting money into an emergency savings plan could mean putting less money—or no money at all—into a retirement account. This already adds to the worrying fact that many Americans have less than $100,000 saved for retirement, according to a January 2020 survey by TD Ameritrade.6

Additional Employer Expense

With new accounts comes new fees for employers. Small businesses or companies already running lean due to the pandemic might not be able to afford additional fees and expenses right now, or have the administrative bandwidth to execute. And that means your company may not be able to offer this option even if you pitch it to your HR department.

The Bottom Line

As the public health crisis and economic downturn significantly impacts many households, you may need more immediate financial assistance—especially through your employer. 

If you think an employer-sponsored emergency savings plan is right for your company, talk to your HR department and potential plan sponsors. They can look into implementing a plan and addressing the fiscal, logistical, and operational issues that come with it. In the process, you may be able to have managers and leadership teams gather thoughts and feedback from other employees via anonymous surveys and group or one-on-one meetings. If your company is able to offer this rainy-day option, it could potentially be pivotal to your financial stability.

Money is a tool that can help you to achieve your goals. It can provide comfort and stability for your family, make it easier to plan for the future, and allow you to save towards important milestones. But to achieve these things, you need to know how to make your money work for you.

What Does It Mean To Make Your Money Work For You?

Making your money work for you means taking control of your finances, then using that control to continuously improve your financial stability and security.

You may eventually be able to gain financial independence or build wealth through investing. But neither of those things can happen without first understanding where your money is going and learning better ways to use it.

Learn To Budget

A budget is a vital tool for changing the way you handle your money.

When you are budgeting, you understand where your money is coming from and are purposeful about where you spend it. You are making your money do what you want it to do, rather than spending without a plan.

Note

The goal of budgeting is to always spend less than you earn.

When you create a budget, you assign every dollar you earn to a spending category. You can use a budget to:

Reduce your spending
Understand where your money is going
Identify bad financial habits
Pay off debt
Avoid creating new debt
Prioritize spending on things that are important to you
Save for the future1

Budgeting is not a one-time action. It should be something you actively engage in every day. You may need to adjust your budget from month to month to account for large expenses or your own spending habits.

When you know how much income you have, you can decide where to put it. When you are deliberate about where you spend it, you are in control of your money. This is the first step towards making it work the way you want to, rather than feeling controlled by your finances.

Get Out of Debt

When you are in debt, you pay more than the cost of the original purchase. You also have to make interest payments that can substantially cut into your income.

Debt means your money isn't working for you, it's going towards paying that interest. It creates a financial burden and limits the choices that you can make.

Paying off debt, by contrast, allows you to take that money and redirect it toward the things that are important to you. You can put it toward other financial goals, such as saving for education, creating a retirement fund, traveling, or improving your living situation. You can start a business. You can begin investing it, allowing you to grow your wealth and create more financial stability and independence.

If you have a lot of debt and are feeling overwhelmed, you can use the snowball method to control the debt repayment process.

Pay only the minimum payment on all your debts except the smallest one.
Put whatever extra money you have toward paying off the smallest debt.
Once it's paid off, move onto the next smallest.

As you pay off your smaller debts, you'll have more money available to pay off your larger debts. This momentum helps you focus your efforts and get out of debt more quickly.2﻿ 

Create an Emergency Fund

Surprises are scary when you do not have control of your finances. An unexpected car repair, a medical procedure, a job loss, or any other financial emergency can quickly send you spiraling into new or more debt, wiping out any progress you've made towards taking control of your money.

Creating an emergency fund is another way to make your money work for you because it means you have planned for surprises. If an emergency does come up, you can put the money in your fund to work and regain control of the situation.

Building an emergency fund can take time. Ideally, you should save the equivalent of three to six months' worth of income. But every little bit you can set aside will help. If you are still paying off debt or don't have much wiggle room in your budget, set aside whatever you can in a ""surprise expenses"" category in your budget. At the end of the month, transfer whatever is in this category to a separate savings account.

Note

Put your emergency savings in a high-yield savings account, which will earn more interest than a regular saving or checking account. This means that the money you save will make money while it's sitting in your bank account. If your bank doesn't offer high-yield accounts or you live in a rural area without a bank, look for online banking options to open an account.

Once you are out of debt or have more money free money in your budget, you can set up larger recurring contributions to grow your emergency fund even faster.3﻿

Save and Invest Your Money

Once you have freed up all that extra money from paying off your debt, you can put your money to work through savings and investments. What you save for will depend on your age, lifestyle, and goals.

In addition to an emergency fund, you will also need retirement accounts. You should also consider whether you need:

Education savings, for yourself or your children
Travel savings
A down payment fund for a house
Savings to start a business
A car fund, for repairs or a new vehicle
Extracurricular fund for dependents
Long-term care savings, for yourself or dependents

By creating designated savings funds, you can track your progress toward specific goals. You can also put those savings in a high-interest account, money market account or CD (certificate of deposit) in order to earn interest on your money.

Note

Remember, when you pay interest, you are losing money. But when you earn interest, your money is making more money all by itself.

If you won't need your savings for several years or decades, one of the best ways to make your money work for you is to invest.

When you put your money into investments, it grows all on its own through interest or the increased value of the thing you invested in. Some investments also pay dividends, which you can either take as extra income or reinvest to help your portfolio grow.

Note

Investing is a long-term strategy for building wealth. The most successful investors invest early, then allow their money to grow for years or decades before using it as income. Constantly buying and selling investments is likely to make less money than a buy-and-hold strategy in the long run.

As you start investing, it is important to diversify your portfolio. Having all your money in just one type of investment increases your risk. If that single investment fails, all your money could be gone. Instead, spread that risk out by investing in a mix of:

Stocks
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
Government bonds
Mutual funds
Real estate
Business (your own or someone else's)4
Note

Many mutual funds or brokerage firms have a minimum amount for first-time investors. You may need to save up that minimum amount before you start investing. In the meantime, you can start small with investing apps that allow you to purchase fractional shares by investing amounts as small as $1 at a time.

No matter how you are saving or investing, have a specific set of goals. Know what you are working towards, like paying for your child's education, purchasing a home, or early retirement. This will help focus your spending and give you motivation, as well as helping you decide what types of investments are the best for you.

THE BALANCE / JULIE BANG

The Greek debt crisis is the dangerous amount of sovereign debt Greece owed the European Union between 2008 and 2018. In 2010, Greece said it might default on its debt, threatening the viability of the eurozone itself.1

To avoid default, the EU loaned Greece enough to continue making payments.

Note

Since the debt crisis began in 2010, the various European authorities and private investors have loaned Greece nearly 320 billion euros.

It was the biggest financial rescue of a bankrupt country in history.2 As of January 2019, Greece has only repaid 41.6 billion euros. It has scheduled debt payments beyond 2060.

In return for the loan, the EU required Greece to adopt austerity measures. These reforms were intended to strengthen the Greek government and financial structures. They did that, but they also mired Greece in a recession that didn’t end until 2017.

The crisis triggered the eurozone debt crisis, creating fears that it would spread into a global financial crisis. It warned of the fate of other heavily indebted EU members. This massive crisis was triggered by a country whose economic output is no bigger than the U.S. State of Connecticut.3

Greece Crisis Explained

In 2009, Greece’s budget deficit exceeded 15% of its gross domestic product.2 Fear of default widened the 10-year bond spread and ultimately led to the collapse of Greece’s bond market. This would shut down Greece’s ability to finance further debt repayments. The chart below highlights in red the period when the 10-year government bond yield passed 35% until vast debt restructuring forced private bondholders to accept investment losses in exchange for less debt.

EU leaders struggled to agree on a solution. Greece wanted the EU to forgive some of the debt, but the EU didn’t want to let Greece off scot-free.

The biggest lenders were Germany and its bankers. They championed austerity measures. They believed the measures would improve Greece's comparative advantage in the global marketplace. The austerity measures required Greece to improve how it managed its public finances. It had to modernize its financial statistics and reporting. It lowered trade barriers, increasing exports.

Most importantly, the measures required Greece to reform its pension system. Pension payments had absorbed 17.5% of GDP, higher than in any other EU country. Public pensions were 9% underfunded, compared to 3% for other nations. Austerity measures required Greece to cut pensions by 1% of GDP. It also required a higher pension contribution by employees and limited early retirement.4

Half of Greek households relied on pension income since one out of five Greeks were 65 or older.5 Workers weren’t thrilled paying contributions so seniors can receive higher pensions. 

The austerity measures forced the government to cut spending and increase taxes. They cost 72 billion euros or 40% of GDP. As a result, the Greek economy shrank 25%. That reduced the tax revenues needed to repay the debt. Unemployment rose to 25%, while youth unemployment hit 50%.6 Rioting broke out in the streets. The political system was in upheaval as voters turned to anyone who promised a painless way out. 

The results are mixed. In 2017, Greece ran a budget surplus of 0.8%.7 Its economy grew 1.4%, but unemployment was still 22%.8 One-third of the population lived below the poverty line. Its 2017 debt-to-GDP ratio was 182%.

Timeline

In 2009, Greece announced its budget deficit would be 12.9% of its GDP.2 That's more than four times the EU's 3% limit. Rating agencies Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's lowered Greece's credit ratings. That scared off investors and raised the cost of future loans.

In 2010, Greece announced a plan to lower its deficit to 3% of GDP in two years. Greece attempted to reassure the EU lenders it was fiscally responsible. Just four months later, Greece instead warned it might default.2

The EU and the International Monetary Fund provided 240 billion euros in emergency funds in return for austerity measures. The loans only gave Greece enough money to pay interest on its existing debt and keep banks capitalized. The EU had no choice but to stand behind its member by funding a bailout. Otherwise, it would face the consequences of Greece either leaving the Eurozone or defaulting.9 Austerity measures required Greece to increase the VAT tax and the corporate tax rate. It had to close tax loopholes. It created an independent tax collector to reduce tax evasion. It reduced incentives for early retirement. It raised worker contributions to the pension system. At the same time, it reduced wages to lower the cost of goods and boost exports. The measures required Greece to privatize many state-owned businesses such as electricity transmission. That limited the power of socialist parties and unions. 

Why was the EU so harsh? EU leaders and bond rating agencies wanted to make sure Greece wouldn't use the new debt to pay off the old. Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Portugal, Ireland, and Spain had already used austerity measures to strengthen their own economies. Since they were paying for the bailouts, they wanted Greece to follow their examples. Some EU countries like Slovakia and Lithuania refused to ask their taxpayers to dig into their pockets to let Greece off the hook.10 These countries had just endured their own austerity measures to avoid bankruptcy with no help from the EU. 

In 2011, the European Financial Stability Facility added 190 billion euros to the bailout. Despite the name change, that money also came from EU countries.

By 2012, Bondholders finally agreed to a haircut, exchanging 77 billion euros in bonds for debt worth 75% less.

In 2014, Greece’s economy appeared to be recovering, as it grew 0.7%. The government successfully sold bonds and balanced the budget.

In January 2015, voters elected the Syriza party to fight the hated austerity measures. On June 27, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced a referendum on the measures. He falsely promised that a ""no"" vote would give Greece more leverage to negotiate a 30% debt relief with the EU. On June 30, 2015, Greece missed its scheduled 1.55 billion euros payment.11 Both sides called it a delay, not an official default. Two days later, the IMF warned that Greece needed 60 billion euros in new aid. It told creditors to take further write-downs on the more than 300 billion euros Greece owed them. 

On July 5, Greek voters said ""no"" to austerity measures.12 The instability created a run on the banks. Greece sustained extensive economic damage during the two weeks surrounding the vote. Banks closed and restricted ATM withdrawals to 60 euros per day. It threatened the tourism industry at the height of the season, with 14 million tourists visiting the country. The European Central Bank agreed to recapitalize Greek banks with 10 billion euros to 25 billion euros, allowing them to reopen.13

Banks imposed a 420 euros weekly limit on withdrawals. That prevented depositors from draining their accounts and worsening the problem. It also helped reduce tax evasion. People turned to debit and credit cards for purchases. As a result, federal revenue increased by 1 billion euros a year.

On July 15, the Greek parliament passed the austerity measures despite the referendum.14 Otherwise, it would not receive the EU loan of 86 billion euros. The ECB agreed with the IMF to reduce Greece’s debt. It lengthened the terms, thus reducing net present value. Greece would still owe the same amount. It could just pay it over a longer time period. 

On July 20, Greece made its payment to the ECB, thanks to a loan of 7 billion euros from the EU emergency fund. The United Kingdom demanded the other EU members guarantee its contribution to the bailout.

On September 20, Tsipras and the Syriza party won a snap election.15 It gave them the mandate to continue to press for debt relief in negotiations with the EU. However, they also had to continue with the unpopular reforms promised to the EU. 

In November, Greece's four biggest banks privately raised 14.4 euros billion as required by the ECB.16 The funds covered bad loans and returned the banks to full functionality. Almost half of the loans banks had on their books were in danger of default. Bank investors contributed this amount in exchange for the 86 billion euros in bailout loans. The economy contracted 0.2%.

In March 2016, the Bank of Greece predicted the economy would return to growth by the summer. It only shrank 0.2% in 2015, but the Greek banks were still losing money. They were reluctant to call in bad debt, believing that their borrowers would repay once the economy improved. That tied up funds they could have lent to new ventures. 

On June 17, the EU's European Stability Mechanism disbursed 7.5 billion euros to Greece.17 It planned to use the funds to pay interest on its debt. Greece continued with austerity measures. It passed legislation to modernize the pension and income tax systems. It promised to privatize more companies, and sell off nonperforming loans. 

In May 2017, Tsipras agreed to cut pensions and broaden the tax base. In return, the EU loaned Greece another 86 billion euros.13 Greece used it to make more debt payments. Tsipras hoped that his conciliatory tone would help him reduce the 293.2 billion euros in outstanding debt. But the German government wouldn't concede much before its September presidential elections. 

In July, Greece was able to issue bonds for the first time since 2014. It planned to swap notes issued in the restructuring with the new notes as a move to regain investors' trust.

On January 15, 2018, the Greek parliament agreed on new austerity measures to qualify for the next round of bailouts. On January 22, the eurozone finance ministers approved 6 billion to 7 billion euros.13 The new measures made it more difficult for union strikes to paralyze the country. They helped banks reduce bad debt, opened up the energy and pharmacy markets, and recalculated child benefits.

On August 20, 2018, the bailout program ended.2 Most of the outstanding debt is owed to the EU emergency funding entities. These are primarily funded by German banks.

European Financial Stability Mechanism and European Stability Mechanism: 168 billion euros
Eurozone governments: 53 billion euros.
Private investors: 34 billion euros.
Greek government bond holders: 15 billion euros.
European Central Bank: 13 billion euros.
IMF: 12 billion euros. 

Until the debt is repaid, European creditors will informally supervise adherence to existing austerity measures. The deal means that no new measures would be created.

Causes

How did Greece and the EU get into this mess in the first place? The seeds were sown back in 2001 when Greece adopted the euro as its currency. Greece had been an EU member since 1981 but couldn't enter the eurozone. Its budget deficit had been too high for the eurozone's Maastricht Criteria.3 

All went well for the first several years. Like other eurozone countries, Greece benefited from the power of the euro. It lowered interest rates and brought in investment capital and loans.

In 2004, Greece announced it had lied to get around the Maastricht Criteria.18 The EU imposed no sanctions. Why not? There were three reasons.

France and Germany were also spending above the limit at the time. They'd be hypocritical to sanction Greece until they imposed their own austerity measures first.

There was uncertainty on exactly what sanctions to apply. They could expel Greece, but that would be disruptive and weaken the euro.

The EU wanted to strengthen the power of the euro in international currency markets. A strong euro would convince other EU countries, like the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden, to adopt the euro.

As a result, Greek debt continued to rise until the crisis erupted in 2008.

Why Greece Didn't Leave the Eurozone

Greece could have abandoned the euro and reinstated the drachma. Without the austerity measures, the Greek government could have hired new workers. It would have lowered the 25% unemployment rate and boosted economic growth. Greece could have converted its euro-based debt to drachmas, printed more currency and lowered its euro exchange rate. That would have reduced its debt, lowered the cost of exports, and attracted tourists to a cheaper vacation destination.

At first, that would seem ideal for Greece, but foreign owners of Greek debt would have suffered debilitating losses as the drachma plummeted. That would debase the value of repayments in their own currency. Some banks would go bankrupt. Most of the debt is owned by European governments, whose taxpayers would foot the bill.

Plummeting drachma values would have triggered hyperinflation, as the cost of imports skyrocketed. Greece imports 40% of its food and pharmaceuticals and 80% of its energy.19

Many companies refused to export these items to a country that might not pay its bills. The country couldn't attract new foreign direct investment in such an unstable situation. The only countries that would have lent to Greece are Russia and China. In the long run, Greece would find itself back to where it began: burdened with debt it couldn't repay. 

Interest rates on other indebted countries would have risen. Rating agencies would worry they'd leave the euro also. The value of the euro itself would have weakened as currency traders use the crisis as a reason to bet against it. 

Why Greece Didn't Default

A widespread Greek default would have a more immediate effect. First, Greek banks would have gone bankrupt without loans from the European Central Bank. Losses would have threatened the solvency of other European banks, particularly in Germany and France. They, along with other private investors, held 34.1 billion euros in Greek debt.20

Eurozone governments owned 52.9 billion euros. That's in addition to the 131 billion euros owned by the EFSF, essentially also eurozone governments. Germany owned the most debt, but it was a tiny percentage of its GDP. Much of the debt didn't come due until 2020 or later. Smaller countries faced a more serious situation. Finland's portion of the debt was 10% of its annual budget. The ECB held 26.9 billion euros of Greek debt.

If Greece had defaulted, the ECB would have been fine. It was unlikely that other indebted countries would have defaulted. 

For these reasons, a Greek default wouldn’t have been worse than the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management debt crisis. That's when Russia's default led to a tidal wave of defaults in other emerging market countries. The IMF prevented many defaults by providing capital until their economies had improved. The IMF owns 21.1 billion euros of Greek debt, not enough to deplete it.21

The differences would be the scale of defaults and that they are in developed markets. It would affect the source of much of the IMF's funds. The United States wouldn’t be able to help. While a huge backer of IMF funding, it's now deep in debt, itself. There would be no political appetite for an American bailout of European sovereign debt. 

Outlook

Despite austerity measures, many aspects of Greece’s economy are still problematic. Government spending makes up 48% of the GDP while EU bailouts contribute around 3%.22 As of 2017, Greece relies on tourism for 20% of GDP. Bureaucracy often delays commercial investments for decades. The government has shrunk, but it is still inefficient. There is too much political patronage. Government decision-making is centralized, further slowing response time.

This bureaucracy, combined with unclear property rights and judicial obstacles, has kept Greece from selling 50 billion euros worth of state-owned assets. Only 6 billion euros worth of property has been sold since 2011.

Tax evasion has gone underground as more people operate in the black economy. It now comprises 21.5% of GDP. As a result, fewer people are paying higher taxes to receive less from the government than they did before the crisis.

Many of the jobs available are part-time and pay less than before the crisis. As a result, hundreds of thousands of the best and brightest have left the country. Banks haven’t completely recuperated, and are hesitant to make new loans to businesses. It will be a slow road to recovery.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
When did the Greek debt crisis begin?

The Greek debt crisis began in 2009. The country revealed that the budget deficit had surpassed 15% of GDP. This borrowing spike relative to productivity caused credit agencies to downgrade Greek debt.2

How did the Greek debt crisis affect the American economy?

The U.S. did not directly assist Greece during its debt crisis, so it didn't feel an immediate impact. Europe is a major trade partner with the U.S., so the severe impact on Europe's economy did pose some threat to American economic stability, but the Greek debt crisis wasn't a direct threat in and of itself.9

Risks of Solar-Specific Loans
Conclusion
Executive Summary

The market for residential solar panels continues to grow, in large part due to declining solar panel costs and increased government incentives, including tax credits. With that growth, the marketing and door-to-door sales of solar-related financial products have become more prevalent.

This Issue Spotlight provides an overview of the most common solar financing business models. Due to the size of the marketplace and the scope of potential consumer harm, this spotlight pays specific attention to risks stemming from the presentation and structure of “solar-specific” loans, which are often facilitated by large financial technology (“fintech”) firms via a point-of-sale partnership with solar installers.

Consumer Risks
Hidden markups and fees. The CFPB has found that some lenders include substantial markups and fees that can increase the loan principal by 30 percent or more above the cash price. Lenders frequently bake these fees (commonly referred to within the industry as “dealer fees”) into the loan principal but often do not indicate that these fees are a markup from the total cash price that consumers pay for the system installation.
Misleading statements concerning federal tax credits. Many solar loan sales pitches promote the 30 percent federal “Investment Tax Credit” for residential solar installations with a presumption of universality. However, the tax credit is not a guarantee—it depends on the consumer’s federal tax liability. Compounding the potential harm are solar loan marketing materials that deduct the presumed tax credit from the loan amount to present a so-called “net cost.” This framing can hide the true cost of the loan by leading consumers to believe that the “disclosed net cost” is in fact the loan principal. Low-income consumers are less likely to receive a tax credit and therefore more likely to face unexpected costs.
Misrepresentations and omissions concerning “voluntary” prepayments. Many solar loans are structured to increase the required monthly payment unless the borrower prepays a large share of the loan principal—typically 30 percent, which is the presumptive amount of the federal tax credit. However, many consumers are surprised by the prepayment expectation, do not receive the presumptive amount of the tax credit, or will not have the funds to remit that prepayment. As a result, they will face large increases to their monthly payments.
Misrepresentations regarding financial benefits. While households can generate substantial savings from solar energy installation, the CFPB identified misleading statements and marketing materials. Consumers report being told that solar panels will not only cover the cost of the financing but also eliminate future energy bills, when the actual financial benefits are uncertain and can vary significantly by geographic location and season, among other factors.
Market Overview
Scope

The market for solar-powered electricity in the United States continues to expand, with a corresponding growth in financing methods. This Issue Spotlight addresses the most common methods for financing the cost of residential solar panels. It includes descriptions of loans and leases for at-home rooftop solar installations, along with an overview of the market for community solar, an option for solar energy located away from the consumer's residence.1

Market Summary

Industry reports state that in 2023, solar energy represented 55 percent of new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid, up from 44 percent in 2022, 23 percent in 2018, and 4 percent in 2010.2 The residential segment, approximately one fifth of the overall solar market, installed 6.8 direct-current gigawatts of solar capacity in 2023—up 13 percent from 2022 and 62 percent from 2021.3

A major driver of this growth is the falling cost of solar panels. According to one study from an alternative energy marketplace, the median nationwide installation cost of residential solar panels fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.80 in 2023.4

Federal legislation encouraging the adoption of solar energy has also contributed to the heightened demand. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act created a new tax credit (often referred to as the “Investment Tax Credit”) specifically tied to the installation of residential solar projects.5 Eligible homeowners can use the credit to reduce their federal income tax liability by a certain percentage of the project’s installation cost. The size of the credit has varied over time based on subsequent legislation, never exceeding 30 percent. The credit is also non-refundable, meaning that if the potential credit exceeds a person’s federal tax liability, they can only claim enough to reduce their liability to zero. Individuals or households with no federal tax liability will not be able to claim any of the tax credit.

The Investment Tax Credit was set to expire at the end of 2024, but the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 renewed it through 2034. From 2022 through 2032, the value of the tax credit will be 30 percent of the solar panels’ installation cost, before dropping to 26 percent in 2033 and 22 percent in 2034.6

Many private lenders and their sales partners have made tax benefits a staple of their marketing and customer acquisition strategies. As described in the next section, lenders can exaggerate or double count these benefits in ways that are potentially misleading.

Another source of recent notable solar-related federal subsidies is the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund: $27 billion directed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for “mobilizing financing and private capital for greenhouse gas- and air pollution-reducing projects in communities across the country.”7 A portion of the program’s funds will address the residential solar market, though the specifics are the purview of the over 60 grant recipients that were finalized in April 2024.8

Analysis from researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, provides insight into the income and demographic trends of consumers who purchased residential solar panels.9 The researchers found that approximately 45 percent of solar adopters in 2022 had incomes below 120 percent of their area median income, with 23 percent of adopters falling below 80 percent of area median income. They also found that “[s]olar adoption continues to shift toward less affluent households, with the median current income of solar adopters dropping from $140k for households that installed systems in 2010 to $117k in 2022.” While overall solar adopters are more likely to identify as non-Hispanic white, Berkeley Lab found that among owner-occupied households, “minority households collectively have a greater propensity to adopt [residential solar panels] than non-Hispanic White households.”10

Solar Financing Models

Consumers can access solar energy either directly, via at-home rooftop installations, or indirectly, via largescale community solar projects located away from individual homeowners’ property. The at-home rooftop installation market is available almost exclusively to homeowners, while community solar projects are often open to both homeowners and renters. Within those two broad categories, consumers have several options for securing loans and leases to defray the upfront costs of solar energy.11

At-home rooftop installations

Consumers who wish to avoid paying the cost of installation of solar panels on their rooftops upfront can purchase the panels with a loan or rent the panels. These options are popular because of the high sticker cost: the average residential solar panel installation costs approximately $25,000.12 Another industry report found that cash purchases comprised just 19 percent of the at-home residential solar market in 2023, with loans accounting for 58 percent and third-party ownership 23 percent.13

In many instances, at-home solar panels are designed to allow the homeowner to receive the “net metering” benefits of selling the solar energy they create back to the electrical grid and reduce their monthly electricity bill.14 “In effect,” per the U.S. Department of Energy, “the customer uses excess generation to offset electricity that the customer otherwise would have to purchase at the utility’s full retail rate.”15 However, net metering is not available in all jurisdictions and, where available, it can have terms and conditions that reduce the value to residential utility customers.16

Consumers who purchase solar panels (either with cash or a loan) may be eligible for two additional financial benefits. The first are tax credits, most notably the federal Investment Tax Credit described in Section 2.2. The second is the Solar Renewable Energy Certificate program, in which utility companies pay homeowners for every megawatt hour17 of solar energy that their panels generate. Solar Renewable Energy Certificates only exist in jurisdictions with specific requirements in their state renewable standards for how much energy must come from renewable sources. Certain jurisdictions require utilities to purchase solar credits from home and business owners that “count” toward those standards.18

SOLAR-SPECIFIC LOANS

The most common form of solar financing consists of fixed-term, usually fixed-rate installment loans that cover the price of the panels and installation. These loans are typically referred to as private because they are not issued by a federal or state agency.

There are several types of private loans for solar installations. The first is a loan from a lender who specializes in solar finance (“solar-specific loan”), which is often offered with the panel installation contract and includes provisions unique to the solar industry. Other options include general-purpose unsecured installment loans, lines of credit, and home equity loans and lines from banks, credit unions, and nonbank financial technology firms.

This Issue Spotlight focuses on solar-specific loans due to their complex presentation and structure. The distinctions from other loan options begin at the initial point of contact. For general-purpose loans and home equity financing, there is typically a clear dividing line between the financing contract and the installation contract. For solar-specific loans, the sales, installation, and financing often blend into a single interaction, as salespersons, installers, and lenders may work in concert to consummate the sale of a solar system and financing.

Solar salespeople commonly make their first contact with potential customers via a door-to-door introduction.19 The solar salespeople and installers often have agreements between each other, as well as agreements with one or more solar-specific lenders that enable instantaneous loan offers with the installation contract via a digital tablet.

Some of the largest solar-specific private lenders are fintech firms that offer near-nationwide coverage via partnerships with one or more banks to originate their loans. An online industry marketplace that pairs consumers with installers and lenders states that the largest fintech solar lenders by financing quotes offered in H2 ’23 were Solar Mosaic, Inc. (via partner banks Truist, WebBank, DCU, and Connexus), ATMOS Financial Services Inc. (via partner bank Five Star Bank), Dividend Finance Inc. (acquired by Fifth Third Bancorp in 2022), Sunlight Financial LLC (via partner bank Cross River Bank), and EnFin Co. (via partner banks Hatch Bank and EnFin Corp.).20 The report notes a “fragmented” market, with no one lender comprising more than 12 percent of the financing quotes.21 Two years prior, a pair of lenders (Sunlight and Mosaic) collectively captured over 30 percent of the market.22

The stated annual percentage rates (APRs) on solar-specific loans typically range from 1 to 7 percent. However, as discussed later, those APRs often do not include fees that increase the loan principal on top of the cash price of the solar panels.

Solar-specific loan term lengths typically range from 8 to 25 years, but industry data show solar loans are typically repaid in 7 to 9 years due to prepayments.23 Some solar loans are secured by collateral (typically with a lien on the panels themselves), while others are unsecured. As is the case in other consumer lending, secured loans usually come with lower APRs than comparable unsecured loans because the lender has the right to repossess the panels in cases of nonpayment.

If the homeowner sells their home before their solar loan is paid off, they typically have two options that leave the panels with the home: the buyer agrees to legally assume the solar loan if permitted by the lender, or the homeowner pays off the remaining solar loan balance prior to the sale of the home. It is not typical for homeowners to move their panels to a new home due to the potential for damaging the panels or the house.

GOVERNMENT-BACKED LOANS

There are several existing federal- and state-sponsored loan programs to finance residential solar projects.24 In some cases, tax dollars directly subsidize the program and pass those benefits along to consumers in the form of lower interest rates. Three existing federal programs are:

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA)’s Solar and Wind Technologies program, which is an amendment to a mortgage at the time of purchase that adds the full cost of the solar panel installation to a regular FHA-insured mortgage.
The FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs Energy Efficient Mortgage program, which is a refinance of a mortgage to include an eligible energy efficient upgrade.
The FHA’s PowerSaver program, which is a second mortgage just for energy-efficient upgrades. Loan sizes range up to $25,000 and up to 20 years at rates of 5 to 10 percent, with the FHA guaranteeing up to 90 percent of the loan.
LEASE

In a lease, sometimes referred to in the industry as a “straight solar lease,” the homeowner enters into a contract—either directly with the installer of solar panels or with a third-party lessor—to lease solar panels for a fixed period of time rather than purchase them outright.

Typical solar leases last for 15 to 20 years and require no down payment. In some cases, monthly payments are the same for the life of the lease, but in many cases the payments increase each year by a predetermined amount. The homeowner is still responsible for their standard monthly electricity bills, but they benefit from the solar net metering (if available in their jurisdiction) in many of the same ways as homeowners who choose to purchase the panels. At the end of the lease, the lessor is responsible for uninstalling and removing the panels.

POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Like solar leases, Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are another option in which consumers can benefit from rooftop solar energy without bearing the panel ownership responsibility. PPAs also involve an upfront long-term contract between the consumer and a lessor/installer, but the terms differ from a lease in important ways.

In a PPA, the installer is responsible for setting up and maintaining the solar system on the consumer’s rooftop and for providing electricity to the consumer at a predetermined per-kilowatt-hour rate. This model is known as “paying for energy,” since the consumer pays the installer for the electricity they consume rather than a fixed cost for the panels. In some PPA contracts, the rate is fixed for the duration of the agreement. In others, there are delineated “escalators” that increase the rate in future years and range from 1 to 5 percent.25 Typical PPA contract lengths are six to twenty-five years.26

Community Solar

Community solar has many different forms and business models. The term applies to any agreement between an individual and a third party to finance a large-scale solar project (often called a “solar farm”) situated away from the consumer’s home.27

Community solar enables renters and residents in multi-family homes and apartment buildings to invest in and benefit from renewable electricity. This essentially doubles the potential addressable market for residential solar energy. According to a 2015 National Renewable Energy Laboratory study, “over 50 percent of Americans who would like to use solar energy are unable to install a rooftop solar array.”28 Some community solar business models provide consumers with fixed discounts from their retail electricity bills, while others charge based on individual energy consumption.

Industry reports found that community solar installation volumes (as measured on a per-megawatt basis) stayed relative constant between 2022 and 2023; the lack of growth was attributed to “[i]nterconnection delays and permitting challenges.”29 In 2023, community solar installation volumes were roughly one-sixth the size of at-home residential solar installation volumes.30

Risks of Solar-Specific Loans

There are several consumer risks that apply specifically to private solar-specific loans. Some risks may stem from aggressive sales tactics, but the underlying loan contracts have the potential for consumer harm as well. Four of the most prominent risks are described below. The section concludes with a review of specific consumer populations with the potential for heightened risk.

Hidden Markups and Fees

Many solar-specific lenders assess hidden fees that increase the amount of the loan principal above the cash price. Within the solar industry, these fees are often called “‘program fees,’ ‘lending fees,’ ‘finance fees,’ ‘platform fees,’ ‘original issue discounts,’ and ‘dealer fees.’”31 Hidden fees typically range from between 10 to 30 percent of the cash price but can exceed 50 percent.32

As an example, consider a solar project that would cost $30,000 if the consumer paid in cash (“cash price”), with a $9,000 hidden fee (30 percent of the cash price).

The loan documents would show a loan principal of $39,000 plus interest. The lender would remit the $30,000 cash price to the installer and keep the $9,000 hidden fee. Typically, lenders do not include the hidden fees in the total costs of credit that they present to consumers, and salespeople offering financing often do not explain the difference in the cash price and loan principal.

Consumers' and market participants’ experiences reveal several concerns about hidden fees.33 The following complaints to the CFPB illustrate these concerns.

""I'm currently working with a solar rooftop installer that is offering financing by [LENDER NAME]. The solar installer is saying that if I would like to have financing through this company, that they have to add on 26% of the total cost of the system as an upfront fee. This is a fee that the [LENDER NAME] retains, and not the dealer fee, although it is called a "" dealer fee ''. I confirmed this through many different solar installers that utilized this finance company. I called the company directly to ask for the APR and they said they do not have one. Normally when I [either] apply for or inquire about any loan, the federal government requires the percentage rate be listed, as well as the APR which is the percentage rate plus any fees or charges in relation to the loan. This federal requirement is so that the consumer will know exactly what they are spending on debt service. [LENDER NAME] refused to provide the APR, and instead, they stated that their APR was the interest rate. This meant that they were saying that the interest rate was 1.99 %, and that the APR interest rate was also 1.99 % for a 25 year loan. Mathematically this can not be possible when they are charging a 26 % upfront fee, again called the dealer fee... They are not living up to the spirit or letter of the law and are blatantly lying to the consumer…When I talked with [LENDER NAME], their managerial representation was very angry that I was even asking these questions and seemed shady."" 34




""[LENDERS] pass off HIGH percentage origination charges to the contractor to avoid QC problems of disclosing that as a loan cost is also the point of XXXX I believe…My loan amount was XXXX, so they increased my loan amount to XXXX. I asked the contract how and why and they said [LENDER NAME] added charges to the contractor knowing it would be passed to the consumer."" 35

Some industry stakeholders oppose the use of hidden fees and have combined resources to propose alternative financing solutions.36 They offer loans that do not include a markup on the solar panels’ cash price and instead price all costs of credit into the APR. However, they acknowledge that even when their all-in costs are actually lower, it is difficult to compete for consumers’ business when their disclosed costs of credit are higher than those advertised by lenders who charge hidden fees.

Misleading Statements Concerning Federal Tax Credits

Lenders and installers often incorporate the default expectation of a 30 percent federal tax credit into their marketing materials and loan documentation, giving a potentially misleading impression of the overall price.

A common solar lending industry practice is to present the actual loan in a small, light font, and the “net system cost” (i.e., the loan amount minus the presumed 30 percent tax benefit) in a large, bright font. Consumers may not be familiar with using a tax credit to pay off a portion of a loan and may not fully understand that the actual loan amount is displayed in the smaller, gray font. Often, lenders and installers place disclaimers on the “expected tax credits” in the fine print of consumer agreements or footnotes of advertisements, but these disclaimers may not be obvious enough for consumers to notice.

Promising specific tax savings up front is problematic because lenders and installers seldom if ever know the consumer’s tax situation. This creates at least three problems: First, the credit is not issued until the consumer files federal taxes for the year in which solar project is installed. A consumer who purchased panels in January 2024, for example, may not receive any tax benefit until they file their 2024 taxes in 2025. Second, only higher-income consumers will typically have the requisite federal tax liability to receive the full tax credit. Third, even consumers who do receive the full tax credit may not see any or all those funds in the form of a refund check if their other tax liabilities are large enough that the solar panel credit only reduces their overall taxes owed.

Misrepresentations and Omissions Concerning Prepayments

Unlike some consumer loans that impose prepayment penalties for early repayment, many solar-specific loans effectively require consumers to make substantial partial prepayments. These lenders rely on consumers’ presumptive federal tax credits as the basis for requiring partial loan prepayments.

It is commonplace for solar-specific loans to re-amortize at a higher monthly payment amount at the 19th month of the loan term if the consumer does not make a substantial prepayment before then. Frequently, the necessary prepayment to avoid that re-amortization is 30 percent of the loan principal, which is the current size of the federal Investment Tax Credit.

There are at least two sets of risks and potential harms inherent in this “expected prepayment” practice. First, some consumers have asserted that prepayment was not clearly discussed at the time that they signed the loan documents. Even in instances when the different payment amounts are discussed, the often quick and digital nature of the sales process increases the likelihood that salespeople may guide consumers past these sections. A 2024 investigative report into the industry found that “[c]onsumers don’t catch these extra costs in part because salespeople often present documents to potential customers on tablets or phones, making it easy to skip over the fine print.”37 The report quoted an attorney representing consumers in several civil suits against solar lenders who argued that “finance companies are well aware that salesmen are taking advantage of electronic devices to hide documents from consumers.”38

The second set of risks and potential harms inherent in the “expected prepayment” practice pertains to the payment expectations. As discussed in prior sections, there is no guarantee that all consumers will receive the full federal tax credit or that they will receive a cash refund equal to the size of the full credit. Consumers who do not receive the full 30 percent tax credit as a cash refund and are unable to remit the full expected prepayment will experience a sudden and significant increase in their monthly payment. Those who do receive the full tax credit but are not aware of the prepayment expectation may allocate funds to other financial obligations and thus not have the ability to make the prepayment necessary to prevent the higher payment re-amortization.

The following complaints to the CFPB exemplify these risks.

""The [LENDER NAME] company stated I signed some [loan agreement] that gave me 18 months to accumulate enough solar tax credits to avoid a 26 % fee based on the loan amount {$34000.00}, which they say comes to {$9000.00} and if I do not send a check by XX/XX/XXXX my payment will go from {$180.00} to {$250.00} for 38 years this will mean that I will be paying {$64000.00} for solar panels over 38 years. I did not understand this from the beginning, I was literally e-signing and it was not explained to me, the new loan amount of {$250.00} is {$65.00} additional per month and over 38 year loan will add {$29000.00} to the {$34000.00} loan amount."" 39




""My payment was as expected for a while. Soon I received notice that because my loan balance hadn't fallen below a certain amount, my payment would increase to $ XXXX -- this despite me paying every payment on time for the last XXXX months per the contract ( via autopay ). Over the course of the last XXXX years I have paid only {$2700.00} in principal. I was never informed that I would need to make any additional payments ( on top of my regular installment payments ), nor that if I didn't make additional payments I would also have a greatly increased payment."" 40
Misrepresentations of Financial Benefits

Despite various claims, there is no guarantee that a solar loan will pay for itself—especially when considering the substantial upfront fees included with some solar-specific loans. Some installers misrepresent the future cost of energy and overestimate the amount of electricity that solar panels will produce. Some solar loan agreements note that the consumer’s financial obligation does not depend on the system’s performance, yet many factors can impact a system’s performance, including system design, component quality, installation failures, weather, local rate design, tree growth and other variables.

Population-Specific Risks

Consumers and others have expressed concern to the CFPB about high-pressure and misleading solar sales practices and financing impacting particular populations, including those who are older adults or have limited English proficiency.

The following solar-loan-related complaints to the CFPB from older adults illustrate some of these concerns.

""I was told that I wouldn't have to pay an electric bill and now I pay more on my electric bill with the solar panels. They lied to me and took advantage of me…I called and canceled my service due [to] false pretense. I continue to receive calls and emails of harassment from this company after I have filed a cease and desist against them. I am not well health-wise and this is taking a toll on me even more. I have requested my contract from [LENDER NAME] and they have not sent me a copy. I was told that I would not have to pay them for a year which was a lie and that when I did my taxes I would get {$10000.00} reimbursement which was also a lie."" 41




""I believe that [LENDER NAME] and XXXX XXXX are responsible for claims made by the sales representative 's misrepresentation of the federal tax credit. I believe that the sales representative knew that the tax credit is usually NOT cash received as he made me believe. But as I have since learned the tax credit is used to pay down any tax liability that I may owe at the end of the year. Had that been made clear to me I never would have agreed to the loan. Again during the loan competition process, it was never mentioned or eluded to that I may have to pay 30 % out of pocket to pay down my loan to the expected sales price of {$45000.00}. I am willing to pay the loan. I'm just not willing to pay the loan inclusive of the {$19000.00} tax credit. I know now that this was a bad deal from the start and the federal tax credit was misrepresented to me by both the seller and the lender."" 42




""PREDATORY LENDING, PREDATORY SALES, AND ELDER ABUSE: 30% TAX CREDIT FORCED UPON ME BY BOTH THE SELLER AND THE LENDER WITHOUT MY FULL UNDERSTANDING…Why does the finance company get to further cement the idea that I will be able to use the tax credit to pay down my loan when they have no idea if I even qualify for the tax credit? And, if I did receive the tax credit money in my hand, why does the finance company get to dictate or strongly suggest how I spend the money? [SALESPERSON NAME] leads with the 30 % tax credit and [LENDER NAME] uses the initial low payment as bait to get me to agree to pay the 30 % within 18 months. Because, of course, anyone would rather have a low payment. But, If I dont or cant pay the 30 % then the payment switches to the higher amount. So, instead of starting me at the low payment with the expectation that I will have the money to pay down my loan. LET THE PRICE BE THE PRICE. AND LET MY PAYMENT BE MY PAYMENT. So that the payment doesnt have to balloon after 18 months. Its my right to choose when given a fair choice."" 43

CFPB analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey finds a relationship between age, having solar panels, and reliance on a form of payment other than cash (such as financing by contractor, home equity loans, and other) to make home improvements. Specifically, between 2020 and 2021, 44 percent of older homeowners with solar panels reported relying on these other methods, compared to 36 percent among homeowners aged 18 to 59.44

According to a company that tracks and analyzes direct marketing activity, between 2021 and 2023, consumers ages 18 and older received 8.4 million pieces of mail advertisement that included promotions for solar energy systems’ financing. About one-third of these pieces (34 percent or 2.8 million) were sent to adults ages 60 and older. A large portion (62 percent) of the mail advertisement for solar systems targeted at older adults was part of promotional packages that included ads for other services such as windows, roofing, kitchen remodeling, and other improvements.45

While there is limited data on the extent of solar adoption among limited English proficiency populations, some reports have flagged that in addition to other practices, some solar salespeople are conducting sales pitches targeting limited English proficiency consumers in their preferred language but are providing the solar purchase contract only in English.46

Conclusion

Homeowners have the potential to generate substantial savings by making improvements to their home that generate clean energy and increase energy efficiency. However, these investments require upfront costs that many families must finance.

The CFPB has been working to ensure that costly financing for clean energy does not wipe away expected energy savings or expose the family to serious financial risks. Last year, the CFPB put forth proposed rules regarding property assessed clean energy (PACE) loans, which increase the cost of monthly tax assessments as a way to finance clean energy improvements.

As solar energy installations continue to grow in popularity, the agency will be working closely with federal and state regulators and law enforcement to ensure that the financing of solar energy installations is fair, transparent, and competitive.

Endnotes

There are other solar energy technologies—such as concentrated solar power, which uses mirror or lenses to generate steam-powered electricity—but given their limited use in residential projects they will not be discussed. This Issue Spotlight also does not directly touch upon the growing market for solar energy storage (which allows consumers to store the excess energy produced during the day to use at night) via add-on battery systems.

Executive summary

Working with customers to resolve a problem or answer a question is an essential function for financial institutions – and the basis of relationship banking.1 Customers turn to their financial institutions for assistance with financial products and services and rightfully expect to receive timely, straightforward answers, regardless of the processes or technologies used.

The following research conducted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) explores how the introduction of advanced technologies, often marketed as “artificial intelligence,” in financial markets may impact the customer service experience. The purpose of this report is to explain how chatbot technologies are being used by financial institutions and the associated challenges endured by their customers. The CFPB’s analysis suggests that:

Financial institutions are increasingly using chatbots as a cost-effective alternative to human customer service. Our review found that each of the top 10 largest commercial banks have deployed chatbots as a component of their customer service. Approximately 37% of the U.S. population is estimated to have interacted with a bank’s chatbot in 2022, a figure that is projected to grow.2 As chatbot technology has evolved, so too has banks’ use of the technology. Banks are moving from simple, rule-based chatbots towards more sophisticated technologies such as large language models (“LLMs”) and those marketed as “artificial intelligence.”
Chatbots may be useful for resolving basic inquiries, but their effectiveness wanes as problems become more complex. Review of consumer complaints and of the current market show that some people experience significant negative outcomes due to the technical limitations of chatbots functionality. There are many kinds of negative outcomes for the customer, including wasted time, feeling stuck and frustrated, receiving inaccurate information, and paying more in junk fees. These issues are particularly pronounced when people are unable to obtain tailored support for their problems.
Financial institutions risk violating legal obligations, eroding customer trust, and causing consumer harm when deploying chatbot technology. Like the processes they replace, chatbots must comply with all applicable federal consumer financial laws, and entities may be liable for violating those laws when they fail to do so. Chatbots can also raise certain privacy and security risks.3 When chatbots are poorly designed, or when customers are unable to get support, there can be widespread harm and customer trust can be significantly undermined.
Chatbot use in consumer finance

Financial institutions have long used a variety of channels to interact with prospective and existing customers. Bank branches were created to give customers a place near their homes to conduct banking business and receive customer service and support.4 The ability to ask questions and interact face-to-face with a financial institution has long been a core tenet of relationship banking.

Over time, financial institutions have added contact centers (formerly called call centers), so that customers may more easily interact with their financial institution. As these institutions grew, many contact center functions shifted to interactive voice response technology to route calls to the appropriate personnel and to reduce costs. As new technology became available, financial institutions deployed online interfaces for customer support, such as mobile applications5 and the ability to send and receive messages or through “live chat.” The introduction of chat in consumer finance enabled customers to have real-time, back-and-forth interactions over a chat platform with customer service agents.

Chatbots, which simulate human-like responses using computer programming, were introduced in large part to reduce the costs of human customer service agents. Recently, financial institutions have begun experimenting with generative machine learning and other underlying technologies such as neural networks and natural language processing to automatically create chat responses using text and voices.6 Below we describe the use of chatbots for customer support purposes.

Underlying technology, including the use of large language models and “artificial intelligence”

Chatbots are computer programs that mimic elements of human conversation. Though they can vary substantially in terms of sophistication, automation, and features, they all ingest a user’s input and use programming to produce an output.7

Rule-based chatbots use either decision tree logic or a database of keywords to trigger preset, limited responses. These chatbots may present the user with a set menu of options to select from or navigate the user between options based on a set of keywords and generate replies using predetermined rules. The user is typically limited to predefined possible inputs.8 For example, a bank chatbot may list a set number of options for the consumer to choose from, such as checking their account balance or making a payment.

More complex chatbots use additional technologies to generate responses. Specifically, these chatbots may be designed to use machine learning or technology often marketed as “artificial intelligence” to simulate natural dialogue.9 Other complex chatbots use LLMs to analyze the patterns between words in large datasets and predict what text should follow in response to a person’s question.10

Domain-specific chatbots are intended to help users accomplish specific tasks and their functionality is limited to a topic area such as healthcare, education, or banking.11 Our analysis is focused on chatbots in the financial industry.

Growth and adoption in the financial industry

Chatbots are featured prominently across the financial industry, including on the websites, mobile applications, and social media accounts of banks, mortgage servicers, debt collectors, and other financial companies. In 2022, over 98 million users (approximately 37% of the U.S. population) engaged with a bank’s chatbot. This number is projected to grow to 110.9 million users by 2026.12

Notably, among the top 10 commercial banks in the country, all use chatbots of varying complexity to engage with customers. These chatbots sometimes have human names, use popup features to encourage engagement, and can even exchange direct messages on social media accounts. The adoption of chatbots by financial institutions to provide customer service may be explained by certain features, such as their 24/7 availability and immediate responses.13 Adoption may also be driven by cost savings for these institutions. For example, reports show that when compared to the use of human agent customer service models, chatbots deliver $8 billion per annum in cost savings, approximately $0.70 saved per customer interaction.14

Chatbots have been part of the financial marketplace for almost a decade and their popularity has grown steadily over the years.15 Today, much of the industry at least uses simple rule-based chatbots with either decision tree logic or databases of keywords or emojis that trigger preset, limited responses. Often, these chatbots are powered by proprietary third-party technology companies. For example, Kasisto provides conversational, financially focused chatbots for JPMorgan Chase and TD Bank,16 while Interactions supports Citibank.17

As adoption of chatbots has grown, some institutions, such as Capital One, have built their own chatbot technologies by training algorithms on real customer conversations and chat logs.18 Capital One launched Eno, an SMS, or text messaging, chatbot, in March 2017.19 Much like other banking chatbots, Capitol One claims that Eno can check account balances, review recent transactions and available credit, know when payments are due, pay a bill, activate a card, lock or replace a card, update personal information, find account numbers, and add authorized users.20 Similarly, Bank of America announced its own chatbot, Erica, in 2018. By October 2022, Erica had been used by nearly 32 million customers in over 1 billion interactions.21

More recently, the banking industry has begun to adopt advanced technology such as generative chatbots and others marketed as ""artificial intelligence."" For example, in April 2023, Goldman Sachs’s Chief Information Officer suggested that the bank’s engineering staff start creating its own “ChatGS” or LLM chatbot to help the bank’s employees store knowledge and answer key customer questions on-demand.22

As the industry’s use of chatbot technology has advanced, it has done so in some instances by relying on the largest technology companies for datasets or platforms. For example, in September 2022, Truist announced its digital assistant built on top of Amazon Lex, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) product.23 Wells Fargo announced in October 2022 the launch of Fargo, a new chatbot virtual assistant using Alphabet’s Google Cloud platform to utilize LLMs to process customer’s input and provide tailored responses.24 Additionally, Morgan Stanley announced that it is testing a new chatbot, powered by Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s GPT 4 technologies to feed scripts to financial advisors.25

Chatbot functionality isn’t limited to just text exchanges. For example, U.S. Bank launched Smart Assistant through a mobile app in June 2020. Smart Assistant responds primarily to voice prompts and allows for text inquiries as a secondary alternative.26 Like other banking chatbots, Smart Assistant follows simple rule-based functionality designed to do everyday banking tasks, including finding users’ credit score, transferring money between accounts, disputing transactions, and facilitating payments to other users through Zelle.27

Many financial companies have also expanded their use of rule-based chatbots to those powered by social media platforms. Among the top 10 banks in the country, most enable direct messages and business chat on either Twitter, or Meta’s Facebook and Instagram. Facebook and Instagram’s Business Chat produces automated responses, among other features.28

Areas of interest

In the same way that customer support shifted from in-person to remote call centers decades ago, sectors across the economy are now moving from human support to algorithmic support.

The CFPB collects complaints from the public on consumer financial products and services. With the growing use of chatbots by financial institutions, complaints from the public increasingly describe issues people experienced when interacting with chatbots. In some cases, these issues raise questions about compliance with existing law. Below we describe some of the challenges experienced by customers, as detailed in complaints submitted to the CFPB. We also examine issues across the industry posed by the use of chatbots.

Limited ability to solve complex problems

The term artificial intelligence, or “AI,” is used to suggest that a customer is engaging with a system that is highly sophisticated and that the answers it provides are indeed intelligent and accurate. But “AI” and automated technologies come in a variety of forms. People may in fact be dealing with a very rudimentary system with little capacity to help beyond retrieving basic information and parroting it back or directing customers to policies or FAQs. In circumstances where “AI” fails to understand the person’s request or the message from the person contradicts the system’s programming, it is not suitable for chatbots to be the primary customer service vehicle.

Difficulties in recognizing and resolving peoples’ disputes

People rely on financial institutions to acknowledge, investigate, and resolve disputes in an accurate and timely manner. Embedded in these customer expectations and legal requirements is that entities accurately identify when a customer is raising a concern or dispute. Chatbots and highly scripted representatives can introduce a level of inflexibility, whereby only specific words or syntax may trigger the recognition of a dispute and begin the process of dispute resolution. As a result, the ability for chatbots and scripts to recognize a dispute may be limited.

Even when chatbots can identify that a dispute is being made by the customer, there may be technical limitations to their ability to research and resolve that dispute. In some cases, customers are disputing transactions or information that is incorrect. Chatbots that are limited to simply regurgitating the same system information that the customer is attempting to dispute back to them are insufficient. Such parroting back does not meaningfully handle disputes or inquiries.

One person noted, for example:29

""I engaged their chat service for help and was told that a dispute would be open and that I would receive conditional credit within 48 hours. The following Tuesday I had still not received credit and in their online banking site the dispute is nowhere to be found. I contacted them again…to advise them that the dispute was not opened. The chat agent confirmed that the agent from the prior week did NOT open a dispute and said that they would get it opened. When asked for a case id they were not able to give me one but told me that I would again receive conditional credit and the dispute would appear online within 48 hours. It is now 48 hours later, the dispute has not appeared, and I am chatting with a third agent who I have no doubt will fail in the same way…What is worse is there is not way to contact a person who can actually resolve the situation.""

Moreover, rule-based chatbots tend to be one-way streets, as they are designed to accept or process account information from users and cannot respond to requests outside the scope of their data inputs. A chatbot with a limited syntax can feel like a command-line interface where customers need to know the correct phrase to retrieve the information they are seeking.30 This limitation can be particularly problematic for people with limited English proficiency, where the technology trained on a limited number of dialects makes it difficult for consumers with diverse dialect needs to use chatbots to receive help from their financial institution. Although billed as more convenient, going through the motions of a simulated conversation can be tedious and opaque compared to browsing information with clear and logical navigation. For example, a person recently complained:31

""The app redirected me to their FAQ webpage, which was not specific enough for my situation. The app offered a way to connect via email, however I needed a more immediate response. The preferred method of communication seemed to be via an automated robot, “[ ] Chatbot.'” This chatbot seemed to only pull in the same answers from the FAQ page, none of which were helpful to my situation.""
Providing inaccurate, unreliable, or insufficient information

As detailed further below, chatbots sometimes get the answer wrong.32 When a person’s financial life is at risk, the consequences of being wrong can be grave. In instances where financial institutions are relying on chatbots to provide people with certain information that is legally required to be accurate, being wrong may violate those legal obligations.

Specifically, complex chatbots that use LLMs sometimes have trouble providing accurate and reliable information. For conversational, generative chatbots trained on LLMs, the underlying statistical methods are not well-positioned to distinguish between factually correct and incorrect data. As a result, these chatbots may rely on datasets that include instances of misinformation or disinformation that are then repeated in the content they generate.

Recent studies have suggested that chatbots can provide inaccurate information. For example, a comparative study of Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s BlenderBot, and Alphabet’s LaMDA showed that these chatbots often generate incorrect outputs that are undetectable by some users.33 Recent tests of Alphabet’s Bard chatbot found that it also generated fictional outputs.34 Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT can exacerbate biases in addition to generating incorrect outputs.35 Educators have described chatbots as “not well-suited for tasks that require logic, specialized knowledge, or up-to-date information”36 making the use of conversational chatbots trained on LLMs in banking an unreliable source for responding to customers.

Despite the fact that chatbots can be wrong, users are requesting financial advice from generative chatbots.37 For example, one survey reported that people were using LLM chatbots to request recommendations and advice on credit cards, debit cards, checking and savings accounts, mortgage lenders, and personal loans.38

The use of chatbots in banking is intended to provide customers with immediate, timely help with their issues. When a chatbot is backed by unreliable technology, inaccurate data, or is little more than a gateway into the company’s public policies or FAQs, customers may be left without recourse. Providing reliable and accurate responses to people with regard to their financial lives is a critical function for financial institutions.

Failure to provide meaningful customer assistance

Automated responses by a chatbot may fail to resolve a customer’s issue and instead lead them in continuous loops of repetitive, unhelpful jargon or legalese without an offramp to a human customer service representative. These “doom loops” are often caused when a customer’s issue falls outside the chatbot’s limited capabilities, making it impossible for customers to engage in a robust, and perhaps necessary, conversation with their financial institution. As noted above, some chatbots rely on LLMs to generate responses to common customer inquiries. While some people may be able to get an answer to a specific inquiry using a chatbot, the ability to obtain a clear and reliable response can be complicated by the same technology.

Financial institutions may assert that automated systems are more effective or efficient, for example because a person may get an answer immediately. But automated responses can be highly scripted and simply direct customers to lengthy policy statements or FAQs, which may contain very little helpful information, if any. These systems may simply be offloading the burden of a human having to explain such policies or the responsibility of knowledgeable customer service agents to a cheaper automated process. As a result, several customers have filed complaints with the CFPB about getting stuck in “doom loops” with chatbots. For example:39

""[I] received a debt collection notice from [ ] … claims that I owe them XXX. I do not owe them anything whatsoever. I tried to contact via the phone. This was a complete waste of time - I could not get a human on the phone. There are endless telephone prompts asking me for personal information, account information. I don't have an account, so nothing will populate on their end. I also tried the online chat feature - I ran into loop after loop of the same questions, all of them redirecting me to login to solve my problem. I don't have an account, how can I login? Absurd. If they had humans answer the phone then I wouldn't need to go through this website.""

And another customer complained:40

""I have a credit card with [ ] and my payment is due today…I tried the chat feature and the virtual assistant kept sending me in circles. This is very frustrating and now I am going to get a late fee because I can not get in contact with anyone to pay my bill. I am being sent in an endless loop with no way out. This is a horrible customer experience. As a result, I am going to get a late fee and I reported late on my bureau. I have an excellent payment history and now to no fault of my own, I am being forced to pay late. I do not know which way to turn.""
Hindering access to timely human intervention

Chatbots are programmed to resolve specific tasks or retrieve information and sometimes cannot meaningfully tailor services for a distressed customer. When customers are seeking assistance with financial matters, they may feel anxious, stressed, confused, or frustrated. Research has shown that when people experience anxiety their perspectives on risk and decisions shift.41 A chatbot’s limitations may leave the customer unable to access their basic financial information and increase their frustration. For example, one survey found that 80% of consumers who interacted with a chatbot left feeling more frustrated and 78% needed to connect with a human after the chatbot failed to serve their needs.42 For example, a consumer noted:43

""When I complained to them, they noted that the funds were transferred, but they will not release the funds. I have contacted them to either release the hold on the funds, or return them to me as they have not completed the transaction as agreed. They have failed to do either and are utilizing "" Bots '' to chat with me instead of a human. This is rather frustrating as I have been using [ ] form many years and now this situation is a huge concern. It is at the very least Fraud.""

Consumers may also find offramps to human customer service support further blocked through unreasonable waits. These obstacles not only leave consumers stuck and without help but seriously impact their ability to manage their finances. Consumers have complained to the CFPB about these issues:44

""We have been trying desperately to contact [ ] and any of their live representative because my credit report is wrongfully somehow "" frozen ''. However, I log-in to my [ ] account online to ensure it is "" unlocked and unfroze '' and also called the and [ ] "" chatbot '' electronic answering machine already confirmed that my credit report is "" unlocked '' and "" unfrozen ''. Which means if my report is "" unlocked and unfrozen '' there should not be any problem why the mortgage company cannot pull my report. The reason we are trying to make contact with a live representative is to find out in real time why my credit report is "" unlocked and unfrozen. Myself and the mortgage company has been trying to call them for the last two ( 2 ) weeks but each time we fail to talk to an individual representative to correct the problem and continue with the refinance process.""

Moreover, the limited nature of these chatbots and lack of access to a human customer service representative may not be apparent to customers when they are initially signing up for a relationship with a specific financial institution. It’s not evident until customers experience an issue and must invest time and effort to resolve it, wasting their time, reducing consumer choice, and undercutting financial institutions that are trying to compete by investing in meaningful and effective customer support.

Deploying advanced technologies instead of humans may also be an intentional choice by entities seeking to grow revenue or minimize write offs. Indeed, advanced technologies may be less likely to waive fees, or to be open to negotiation on price.45

Technical limitations and associated security risks
System reliability and downtime

At a high level, the reliability of automated systems is partially dependent on how an entity has decided to prioritize features and allocate development resources. For example, to increase revenue it may be a higher priority to improve the ability of automated systems to promote relevant financial products to a specific customer based on their data. This investment may happen at the expense of features that do not lead to revenue growth. Thus, even if an automated system can handle certain customer functions well, it may be poor at handling others. To put it simply, investment decisions may lead to an underinvestment in the reliability of a chatbot. One person complained that:46

""the computer based chatbot does not render correctly in any browser with strong and fast internet signal. The mobile app chatbot never gets past the step of asking which account I am trying to contact the bank about – instead it enters infinite loop asking the same question over and over.""

Additionally, chatbots can crash, like any other technology. If a broken chatbot is a customer’s only option to receive time sensitive help from their financial institution, it may leave people stranded with little to no customer service. Consumer complaints show us some of the technical limitations of chatbots, for example:47

""I have been unable to make direct contact with them, it appears any numbers only direct you to automated systems and it is impossible to speak to an actual person. I have attached screenshots that show their chatbot just sits on the typing screen and you can not enter any information, and there is no direct customer service number you can call.""

Whether it’s a programming or software issue, a frustrated customer only sees a non-functional chatbot.

Security risks posed by impersonation and phishing scams

Due to their automated nature, chatbots are often used by bad actors to build fake, impersonation chatbots to conduct phishing attacks at scale. Conversational agents often present as “human-like,” possibly leading users to overestimate their capabilities and share more information than they would in a simple web-form. It is then quite dangerous when users share personal information with these impersonation chatbots. In recent years, there has been an increase in scams targeting users of common messenger platforms to get their personal or payment information to then trick them into paying false fees through money transfer apps.48

In addition to using impersonation chatbots to harm consumers, chatbots can also be programmed to phish for information from another chatbot. In these situations, chatbots may be programmed to follow certain privacy and security protocols but are not necessarily programmed to detect suspicious patterns of behavior or impersonation attempts and may not be able to recognize and respond to attempts by scammers to phish for personal information or to steal peoples’ identities.

For example, in May 2022 scammers impersonated DHL – a package delivery and express mail service company – through an email directing victims to a chatbot to request additional shipping costs to receive packages. The chatbot conversation seemed trustworthy because it included a captcha form, email, and password prompts, and even a photo of a damaged package.49

Keeping personally identifiable information safe

Financial institutions have an obligation to keep personally identifiable information safe, regardless of the technology used.50 Security researchers have highlighted a variety of potential vulnerabilities in chatbots, from entities using insecure and outdated web transfer protocols to desperate and frustrated consumers entering personal information into chat platforms because they need help.51

For example, to validate themselves as the owner of a specific account, customers are typically required to provide personal information. When customers provide personal and financial information to a company, they expect it will be handled with care and kept confidential. Therefore, when customers are entering personal information into chat logs, those logs should be considered sensitive consumer information and kept secure from a breach or intrusion. Chat logs introduce another venue for privacy attacks, making it more difficult to fully protect the privacy and security of consumers’ personal and financial information. In 2018, Ticketmaster UK employed Inbenta Technologies for various services, including a “conversational AI” on its payments page. Hackers targeted Inbenta servers, inserting malicious code that recorded information inputted into the chatbot to process payments by platform users, resulting in a cyberattack that affected 9.4 million data subjects, including 60,000 individual payment card details.52

Additionally, LLM-trained chatbots rely on training datasets that contain information about people that may have been illegally obtained.53 Breaches of privacy may occur when training data includes personal information that is then directly disclosed by the model through no fault of the affected individual.54 Some of these risks appear to be recognized by financial institutions, at least as it covers their internal information, as several large banks have restricted use of Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT by their employees.55

The scope of security testing needed for AI systems like chatbots is extensive and requires both rigorous testing and thorough auditing of any third-party service providers involved in operations. There are simply too many vulnerabilities for these systems to be entrusted with sensitive customer data without appropriate guardrails.

The consumer complaints that the CFPB has received about chatbots raise concerns about whether the use of chatbots hinders institutions’ ability to protect the security of consumers’ data.56

Risks associated with the integration of deficient chatbots

As financial institutions continue to invest in technologies such as chatbots to handle customer support while simultaneously reducing costs, they should consider the limitations of the technology such as those detailed in this report. Using chatbot technology as the primary mode of interacting with people can pose several risks for individual financial institutions including the following:

Risk of noncompliance with federal consumer financial laws

Congress passed federal consumer financial laws that place a variety of relevant obligations on financial institutions. These obligations help ensure that financial institutions deal fairly with customers by, amongst other things, providing them with straight answers.

Financial institutions run the risk that when chatbots ingest customer communications and provide responses, the information chatbots provide may not be accurate, the technology may fail to recognize that a consumer is invoking their federal rights, or it may fail to protect their privacy and data.

Risk of diminished customer service and trust when chatbots reduce access to individualized human support agents

When consumers need help from their financial institution, the circumstances could be dire and urgent. If they get stuck in loops of repetitive, unhelpful jargon, unable to trigger the right rules to get the response they need, and they don’t have access to a human customer service representative, their confidence and trust in their financial institution will diminish.

Given the structure of the markets for many consumer financial products and services, people may have limited bargaining power to push for better service when a provider is selected for them. For example, there is little to no consumer choice in the case of selecting a mortgage servicer or credit reporting company. Moreover, even in markets where consumers have more choice, financial institutions may not vigorously compete on certain features, like customer service, as customers are only exposed to those features after they have selected the provider and are, therefore, somewhat locked into them. In such contexts, the opportunity for substantial cost savings might strongly incentivize institutions to route customer support through chatbots or other automated systems even if that diminishes the customer experience to some extent. Importantly, in such markets where competition is lacking or weakened, the extent of cost savings being passed onto consumers in the form of better products and services is diminished.

Financial institutions may go further and reduce or eliminate access to customized human support. However, this reduction likely comes at the expense of service quality and trust. This tradeoff is especially true for customer segments where chatbot interactions have higher rates of failed resolution, such as groups with limited technical availability or limited English proficiency.

Risk of harming people

When chatbots fail in the markets for consumer financial products and services, they not only break customer trust, but they also have the potential to cause widespread harm. The stakes for being wrong when a person’s financial stability is at risk are high. Being able to recognize and handle disputes from customers is an essential function; dispute handling is sometimes the only meaningful way to promptly correct an error before it spirals to worse outcomes.

Deceptive marketing practices about the speed or cost of sending a remittance transfer
Question presented

When do remittance transfer providers violate the prohibition on deceptive acts or practices in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) in their marketing about the speed and cost of sending a remittance transfer?

Response

Remittance transfer providers may be liable under the CFPA for deceptive marketing about the speed or cost of sending a remittance transfer. Providers may be liable under the CFPA for deceptive marketing practices regardless of whether the provider is in compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Remittance Rule. For example, among other things, it may be deceptive to:

Market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to be made available to recipients;
Market remittance transfers as “no fee” when in fact the provider charges fees;
Market promotional fees or promotional exchange rates for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying when an offer is temporary or limited;
Market remittance transfers as “free” if they are not in fact free.
Background
Remittance Transfer Speed and Costs

Pursuant to the CFPB’s Remittance Rule,1 the term “remittance transfer” includes most electronic transfers of funds sent by consumers in the United States to recipients in other countries. Consumers in the United States send hundreds of billions of dollars in remittance transfers to recipients in foreign countries each year.2 Remittance transfers are often consumer-to-consumer transfers of money by immigrants sending financial support to family and friends in other countries. They also include other types of transfers, such as transfers by consumers in the United States to Americans living temporarily abroad, such as students. Consumers may send remittance transfers regularly as an ongoing source of financial assistance or in other circumstances, such as an occasional or emergency form of support. Remittance transfers also include cross-border consumer-to-business payments for goods or services.

Consumers may choose among a range of bank, credit union, and non-bank money transmitters when sending a remittance transfer. Non-bank money transmitters have traditionally dominated the market for remittance transfers from the United States. In recent years, new money transmitters have emerged offering digital remittance transfer services. Many established money transmitters have also added digital services, in addition to in-person options for consumers to go to a store or agent to send remittance transfers.3

When sending remittance transfers, consumers may consider a number of key factors when deciding among different providers, including the speed of the transfer and its cost as well as convenience, security, reliability, and trust.4

The speed of a remittance transfer varies depending on the type of transfer and provider. The World Bank Remittance Prices Worldwide database illustrates that a range of transfer speeds can exist within a given remittance corridor, with some providers, for example, offering delivery in less than an hour, and others offering delivery in three to five days.5

Costs can also vary significantly within a remittance corridor. Remittance transfer costs include fees charged by the remittance transfer provider including, if applicable, their agents and third parties. Costs also include any exchange rate costs applied by the provider to the currency conversion and governmental taxes. The exchange rate offered to consumers often reflects a spread – meaning, a percentage difference between the retail exchange rate offered to the consumer and some wholesale exchange rate.6 Remittance transfer providers utilize different pricing strategies when determining the fees and exchange rate they charge to consumers for remittance transfers.

Transparency Concerns Around Remittance Transfer Speed and Costs

Prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), federal consumer protection laws generally did not apply to remittances, and remittance transfer providers were not consistently required to disclose applicable fees, exchange rates, transfer speeds, and the amount to be received in a transaction. Consumers thus did not always know how much money would be received on the other end and were not able to easily comparison shop among providers.

With the Dodd-Frank Act’s amendments to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the promulgation of the Remittance Rule, remittance transfer providers are now generally required to disclose certain information to consumers before the consumer pays for a transfer and also when payment is made.7 Before the consumer pays for a transfer, the information a remittance transfer provider must disclose includes (but is not limited to): as applicable, the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded; any fees imposed and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer; the total amount of the transaction, which is the sum of the amount that will be transferred and any fees imposed and any taxes collected, in the funding currency; the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer; any covered third-party fees; and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which the funds will be received. The receipt that consumers generally receive when payment is made must contain the same information. In addition, the receipt must disclose the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient.

Compliance with the Remittance Rule disclosure requirements does not obviate the obligation to refrain from misleading marketing practices. In particular, remittance transfer providers must ensure their marketing practices do not violate the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in the CFPA.8

The CFPB has identified problems with transparency and accuracy in marketing practices about the speed of a remittance transfer in its supervision of remittance transfer providers and enforcement of the CFPA’s prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. In the CFPB’s Spring 2022 Supervisory Highlights, the CFPB discussed examiners’ findings that remittance transfer providers made false and misleading representations about the speed of remittance transfers.9 In October 2023, the CFPB issued a consent order against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, finding that the remittance transfer provider made misleading statements in advertisements about the speed and cost of its services, in violation of the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices.10 This provider claimed in social media marketing that remittance transfers would be delivered “instantly,” in “30 seconds” or “within seconds,” and would incur “no fees,” when in fact transfers often took much longer, and the provider charged a fee.11

In addition, consumers have reported, and the CFPB has observed, problems with price transparency in the marketing practices of remittance transfer providers, resulting in consumers encountering unexpected costs.12 The CFPB has received consumer complaints about promotional pricing by remittance transfer providers who do not sufficiently inform consumers that the advertised fee or exchange rate is only a limited scope or temporary offer. The CFPB has also observed marketing claims by remittance transfer providers that may mislead consumers about the scope or duration of a temporary low or “no fee” offer or promotional exchange rate.

The CFPB has also received consumer complaints about marketing that omits or obscures the cost of a remittance transfer. Marketing claims by remittance transfer providers may fail to communicate the full cost of a remittance transfer, such as advertising that transfers are “free” or advertising that prominently emphasizes zero fees while only including a vaguely worded statement that additional costs related to the exchange rate may apply. Some of these statements use technical jargon or feature confusing language.

The CFPB has also received consumer complaints about companies that market “free” remittance transfers through digital wallet and other prepaid products, but that fail to sufficiently disclose costs for currency conversion or for withdrawing funds from the product. Companies that offer remittance transfers through digital wallets and other prepaid products often market them as a faster and cheaper way to send remittance transfers. Certain companies’ websites market “free account-to-account transfers” or that “receiving money from a friend” is free. Providers may disclose only in fine print, however, that these transfers are only free when there is no currency conversion, and that for the recipient to withdraw and use funds in their local currency, they must pay a currency conversion fee. In addition, some digital wallet providers may not make clear that recipients of a remittance transfer must pay a fee to withdraw funds from the digital wallet or other prepaid product. Examples of such fees include fees to transfer funds to an external bank account, credit card, or prepaid card. Consumers have complained to the CFPB that these fees are unexpected when they convert currencies and withdraw funds transmitted through digital wallets and other prepaid products.13

Analysis

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for a provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in deceptive acts or practices.14 A representation, omission, act, or practice is deceptive if it misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer; the consumer’s interpretation is reasonable under the circumstances; and the misleading representation, omission, act, or practice is material.15

It is deceptive to market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to be made available to recipients

Remittance transfer providers violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices if they market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to reach recipients. The CFPB “presumes that express claims are material.”16 Furthermore, as noted above, the speed of a remittance transfer is often a crucial consideration for consumers sending remittance transfers.17 Recipients may rely on remittance transfers for day-to-day expenses or for time-sensitive emergencies.

As illustrated in the CFPB’s action against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, marketing claims about the speed of remittance transfers may violate the prohibition on deceptive acts or practices under the CFPA when the actual time for delivery is longer than advertised.

In the Sendwave case, the provider told consumers that transfers would be delivered “instantly,” “in 30 seconds,” or “within seconds.” These statements were false and misleading because, although a reasonable customer might expect delivery within the time frame advertised, in many instances, transfers were not actually delivered instantly or within seconds for many consumers.18 In addition, as an express marketing statement regarding a central characteristic of the product – when funds would be available to a recipient – the misleading representation was material.19

Providers must thus take care not to engage in deceptive acts or practices in their marketing claims about the speed of a remittance transfer.

It is deceptive to market transfers as “no fee” when in fact the remittance transfer provider charges consumers fees to send the remittance transfer

Remittance transfer providers violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices if they market remittance transfers as having “no fee,” when in fact the remittance transfer provider charges consumers fees to send the remittance transfer. The cost of sending a remittance transfer is a central consideration for consumers,20 and, as discussed above, fees are an important component of the cost of a remittance transfer.21 Expressly misleading price claims violate the prohibition on deceptive practices.22

For example, as alleged in the CFPB’s action against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, from at least 2021 to 2022, Sendwave’s website advertised that consumers could transfer funds from the United States to Nigeria “with no fees.” In fact, consumers were charged fees on all transfers from the United States to Nigeria, despite Sendwave continuing to promote its product as having “no fees” on its website with no qualification or disclaimer.23

The CFPB found that Sendwave’s representations were likely to mislead the consumer and that the consumer’s interpretation would be reasonable under the circumstances. Although Sendwave disclosed a 1% transfer fee in the FAQ section of its website, this did not correct the misleading statement or communication made at the top of its webpage and on a graphic depicting its mobile app.24 And as an express marketing statement regarding a central consideration for consumers when sending a remittance transfer – cost –, the misleading representation about transfer fees was material.25

It may be deceptive to market promotional fees or promotional exchange rates for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying when the offer is only limited or temporary

Remittance transfer providers may violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by advertising promotional pricing for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying that the offer is only limited or temporary in scope, even if the promotional nature of the offer is disclosed in fine print or later in the transaction.26 In such cases, consumers may not understand the pricing is limited and promotional and they may not understand that the cost of sending a remittance transfer through the provider rises after the first or first few transactions.

As the CFPB has articulated, consumers may be reasonably misled when financial service providers fail to clearly and conspicuously disclose material terms in advertising, such as when and by how much charges will increase.27 Written disclosures or fine print in marketing materials would often be insufficient to correct a misleading statement or representation in marketing communications.28 When a consumer’s first contact with a remittance transfer provider involves deception, “the law may be violated even if the truth is subsequently made known” to the consumer.29

Representations in advertising about “no fee” remittance transfers or specific promotional exchange rates without sufficiently clarifying, when applicable, that the offer is only limited or temporary in scope are presumed to be material, as they relate to cost, a key consumer consideration.

In addition, such statements are likely to be material because of their likely impact on a consumer’s initial and subsequent choice of remittance transfer provider. The impact could be particularly significant for promotions offered to first-time customers who seek to continue using the provider to send remittance transfers. Such consumers may face unexpected higher costs after the expiration of the promotion and may also face unexpected hurdles in searching for a different provider. Had they been aware of the limited promotional nature of the offer, a reasonable consumer may have chosen a different provider.

It is deceptive to market remittance transfers as “free” if they are not in fact free

Remittance transfer providers would also violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by marketing remittance transfers as “free” if they are not actually free for the consumer. For example, it may be deceptive to market a remittance transfer as “free” if the remittance transfer provider is imposing costs on consumers through the exchange rate spread for the transfer or, with respect to digital wallets or other prepaid products, if the provider imposes costs to convert funds into a different currency or to withdraw funds from the product.

The FTC has articulated that, under the FTC Act, offers of “free” services “must be made with extreme care so as to avoid any possibility that consumers will be misled or deceived.”30 “The word ‘free’ is a lure. It is the bait. It is a powerful magnet that draws the best of us against our will ‘to get something for nothing.’” Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., 48 F.T.C. 1297, 1312 (1952), aff’d, 202 F.2d 486 (2d Cir. 1953).

A consumer should generally expect that a “free” product or service is indeed free, and that the seller “will not directly and immediately recover, in whole or in part, the cost of [] the service.”31 The FTC has explained that terms, conditions, and obligations that apply to a “free” item should be set forth clearly, conspicuously, and in close conjunction with the offer of the “free” item, and they should further be made clear at the outset of the offer “so as to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood.”32 The same analysis applies to the use of terms that are similar to “free,” such as “gift” or “given without charge.”33

The FTC has recently reiterated that representations of “free” in marketing are deceptive when the offer is not in fact free or when limitations, restrictions, or hidden charges are inadequately disclosed, such that the claim is likely to mislead a reasonable consumer about information important to them when choosing a product.34 As applied here, marketing representations of remittance transfers as free are deceptive under the CFPA if they are not actually free or when limitations, restrictions, or hidden charges are inadequately disclosed.

Marketing a remittance transfer as “free” is likely to cause a reasonable consumer to believe they are sending a remittance transfer without the provider imposing a cost to the consumer. Such interpretation would be incorrect – but reasonable – in instances where the remittance transfer provider is imposing costs through the exchange rate spread for the transfer. In this situation, a remittance transfer provider’s claim that the transfer is “free” would be false and thus likely to be deceptive because there was a cost imposed on the transfer through the exchange rate spread.35

Remittance transfer providers should also be aware of the risk of deception when marketing “free” remittance transfers for digital wallets or other prepaid products. A claim that remittance transfers are “free” may be misleading if the provider in fact imposes costs for recipients to convert funds into a different currency or to withdraw funds from the product. In these circumstances, marketing “free” transfers may constitute a misrepresentation of the terms for the remittance transfer provider’s services that may mislead a reasonable consumer, even with subsequent disclosure of such fees.

About Consumer Financial Protection Circulars

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are issued to all parties with authority to enforce federal consumer financial law. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is the principal federal regulator responsible for administering federal consumer financial law, see 12 U.S.C. 5511, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices, 12 U.S.C. 5536(a)(1)(B), and 18 other “enumerated consumer laws,” 12 U.S.C. 5481(12). However, these laws are also enforced by state attorneys general and state regulators, 12 U.S.C. 5552, and prudential regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the National Credit Union Administration. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5516(d), 5581(c)(2) (exclusive enforcement authority for banks and credit unions with $10 billion or less in assets). Some federal consumer financial laws are also enforceable by other federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the Farm Credit Administration, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Agriculture. In addition, some of these laws provide for private enforcement.

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are intended to promote consistency in approach across the various enforcement agencies and parties, pursuant to the CFPB’s statutory objective to ensure federal consumer financial law is enforced consistently. 12 U.S.C. 5511(b)(4). Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are also intended to provide transparency to partner agencies regarding the CFPB’s intended approach when cooperating in enforcement actions. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5552(b) (consultation with CFPB by state attorneys general and regulators); 12 U.S.C. 5562(a) (joint investigatory work between CFPB and other agencies).

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are general statements of policy under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. 553(b). They provide background information about applicable law, articulate considerations relevant to the Bureau's exercise of its authorities, and, in the interest of maintaining consistency, advise other parties with authority to enforce federal consumer financial law. They do not restrict the Bureau’s exercise of its authorities, impose any legal requirements on external parties, or create or confer any rights on external parties that could be enforceable in any administrative or civil proceeding. The CFPB Director is instructing CFPB staff as described herein, and the CFPB will then make final decisions on individual matters based on an assessment of the factual record, applicable law, and factors relevant to prosecutorial discretion.­

What is an emergency fund?

An emergency fund is a cash reserve that’s specifically set aside for unplanned expenses or financial emergencies. Some common examples include car repairs, home repairs, medical bills, or a loss of income.

In general, emergency savings can be used for large or small unplanned bills or payments that are not part of your routine monthly expenses and spending.




Why do I need it?

Without savings, a financial shock—even minor—could set you back, and if it turns into debt, it can potentially have a lasting impact.

Research suggests that individuals who struggle to recover from a financial shock have less savings to help protect against a future emergency. They may rely on credit cards or loans, which can lead to debt that’s generally harder to pay off. They may also pull from other savings, like retirement funds, to cover these costs.

How much do I need in it?

The amount you need to have in an emergency savings fund depends on your situation. Think about the most common kind of unexpected expenses you’ve had in the past and how much they cost. This may help you set a goal for how much you want to have set aside.

If you’re living paycheck to paycheck or don’t get paid the same amount each week or month, putting any money aside can feel difficult. But, even a small amount can provide some financial security.

Keep reading to find the savings strategy, or strategies, that work best for you.




How do I build it?

There are different strategies to get your savings started. These strategies cover a range of situations, including if you have a limited ability to save or if your pay tends to fluctuate. It may be that you could use all of these strategies, but if you have a limited ability to save, managing your cash flow or putting away a portion of your tax refund are the easiest ways to get started.

Strategy: Create a savings habit

Building a savings of any size is easier when you’re able to consistently put money away. It’s one of the fastest ways to see it grow. If you’re not in a regular practice of saving, there are a few key principles to creating and sticking to a savings habit:

Set a goal. Having a specific goal for your savings  can help you stay motivated. Establishing your emergency fund may be that achievable goal that helps you stay on track, especially when you’re initially getting started. Use our savings planning tool  to calculate how long it’ll take you to reach your goal, based on how much and how often you’re able to put money away.
Create a system for making consistent contributions. There are a number of different ways to save, and as you’ll read below, setting up automatic recurring transfers is often one of the easiest. It may also be that you put a specific amount of cash aside each day, week, or payday period. Aim to make it a specific amount, and if you can occasionally afford to do more, you’ll watch your savings grow even faster.
Regularly monitor your progress. Find a way to regularly check your savings. Whether it’s an automatic notification of your account balance or writing down a running total of your contributions, finding a way to watch your progress can offer gratification and encouragement to keep going.
Celebrate your successes. If you’re sticking with your savings habit, don’t miss the opportunity to recognize what you’ve accomplished. Find a few ways that you can treat yourself, and if you’ve reached your goal, set your next one.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with consistent income. If you know you have a regular paycheck or money consistently coming in, you can create a habit to put some of that money towards an emergency savings fund.




Strategy: Manage your cash flow


Your cash flow  is essentially the timing of when your money is coming in (your income) and going out (your expenses and spending). If the timing is off, you can find yourself running short at the end of the week or month, but if you’re actively tracking it, you’ll start to see opportunities to adjust your spending and savings .

For example, you may be able to work with your creditors (like your landlord, utility companies, or credit card companies) to adjust the due dates for your bills, or you can use the weeks when you have more money available to move a little extra into savings.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone. This is one important first step in managing your money, regardless of whether you’re living paycheck to paycheck or have a tendency to spend more than your budget allows.




Strategy: Take advantage of one-time opportunities to save

There may also be certain times during the year when you get an influx of money. For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. There may be other times of the year, like a holiday or birthday, that you receive a cash gift.

While it’s tempting to spend it, saving all or a portion of that money could help you quickly set up your emergency fund.


Who is this helpful for: Anyone but particularly those with irregular income. If you receive a large check from a tax refund or for some other reason, it’s always good to consider putting all or a portion of it away into savings.

Strategy: Make your saving automatic


Saving automatically is one of the easiest ways to make your savings consistent so you start to see it build over time. One common way to do this is to set up recurring transfers through your bank or credit union so money is moved automatically from your checking account to your savings account. You get to decide how much and how often, but once you have it set up, you’ll be making consistent contributions to your savings.

It’s a good idea to be mindful of your balances, however, so you don’t incur overdraft fees if there’s not enough money in your checking account at the time of the automatic transaction. To help you stay mindful, consider setting up automatic notifications or calendar reminders to check your balance.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with consistent income. Again, you can determine how much and how often to have money transferred between accounts, but you want to make sure you have money coming in. If your situation changes or your income changes, you can always adjust it.




Strategy: Save through work

Another way to save automatically is through your employer. In addition to employer-based contributions for retirement, you may have an option to split your paycheck between your checking and savings accounts. If you receive your paycheck through direct deposit, check with your employer to see if it’s possible to divide it between two accounts. If you’re tempted to spend your paycheck when you get it, this is an easy way to put money aside without having to think twice.

Who is this helpful for: Those with consistent income. Again, if you’re getting a check from your employer on a regular basis, pay yourself first by putting a portion of it automatically into savings.




Where should I keep it?

Where you put your emergency fund depends on your situation. You want to make sure this fund is safe, accessible, and in a place where you’re not tempted to spend it on non-emergencies.

Here are a few options for where to put your emergency savings, and you can choose the one that makes the most sense for you:


Bank or credit union account — If you have an account with a bank or credit union—generally considered one of the safest places to put your money—it might make sense to have a dedicated account where you can keep and maintain these funds.
Prepaid card — A prepaid card is a card that you can load money onto. It’s not connected with a bank or credit union, and you can only spend the amount that’s on your card.
Cash — Another option is keeping money on hand for emergencies, either in your home or with a trusted family member or friend. Keep in mind that cash can be stolen, lost, or destroyed.




When should I use it?

Set some guidelines for yourself on what constitutes an emergency or unplanned expense. Not every unexpected expense is a dire emergency but try to stay consistent. Even if it’s not a trip to the emergency room, you may need it to pay for a medical bill that wasn’t covered by insurance.

Having a reserve fund for financial shocks can help you avoid relying on other forms of credit or loans that can turn into debt. If you use a credit card or take out a loan to pay for these expenses, your one-time emergency expense may grow significantly larger than your original bill because of interest and fees.

However, don’t be afraid to use it if you need it. If you spend down what’s in your emergency savings, just work to build it up again. Practicing your savings skills over time will make this easier.

Executive Summary

This Issue Spotlight explores the challenges that recipients of public cash assistance encounter in accessing funds through financial products or services. Cash assistance predominantly flows to low-income families in need or individuals at a precarious time.1 This includes older Americans via Social Security, low-income children and families via Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), people with disabilities via Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and people who are recently unemployed via unemployment payments. Given the often-acute needs of the populations who receive and rely on cash assistance, it is critical that beneficiaries have full and timely access to these funds.

This Issue Spotlight analyzes the structure of the delivery systems for certain public benefits programs, focusing on TANF, Unemployment programs, and various Social Security payments. It also summarizes CFPB consumer complaints and the results of focus groups with cash assistance recipients.

Cash assistance can be subject to numerous fees that cut into the amount of assistance and can be subject to inaccessible funds due to inadequate customer service. This Issue Spotlight focuses in particular on assistance provided on prepaid cards because of specific recurring issues we have seen arising with the provision of benefits by that method. More specifically,

Consumers can be encouraged by programs to receive their cash assistance through a prepaid card provided by a particular financial institution rather than through direct deposit to an account and financial institution of their choice.
Some prepaid card providers charge numerous fees, such as maintenance, balance inquiry, customer service, or ATM fees, that chip away at people's benefits.
Inadequate customer service from prepaid card providers means that a single problem, such as unauthorized charges on a card, can create a cascade of problems when customer service isn’t available or responsive in a timely manner.

One barrier to reform may be the decentralized nature of public benefits programs that offer cash assistance. Many federal, state, and local entities are involved in running and overseeing these programs. Each program, whether administered by federal or state government, sets up its own system for paying out cash assistance. This decentralized system leaves programs largely unaware of the features of products for which other programs are contracting and creates inconsistencies in products.

Recipients also often have minimal choice in how they receive cash assistance. When cash assistance is provided through a government-administered prepaid card, recipients do not get to choose the specific card and are locked into a relationship with the provider selected by program administrators. Additionally, relatively few vendors participate in the market for government-administered prepaid cards. For these reasons, providers may face minimal competitive pressure from program innovation, new entrants, or customer choice, which may exacerbate or cause the issues with fees and customer service that benefits recipients face.

The CFPB will continue to monitor the practices of entities that facilitate the provision of cash assistance and take action when appropriate to protect consumers from violations of the federal consumer financial laws. We will also collaborate with federal and state agencies that administer public benefits programs to support efforts to increase competition and efficiency in the delivery of cash assistance.

Section 1: Public benefits delivery

Government entities provide cash assistance through a range of programs that were intended to serve many populations—including older adults, individuals with disabilities, people who are unemployed, and low-income families with children. Public benefits programs provide recurring or one-time cash assistance,2 “near cash,”3 or in-kind4 benefits to individuals and families.5 In this Issue Spotlight, we focus specifically on the distribution of recurring cash assistance through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)6, unemployment compensation (“Unemployment”)7, and various Social Security payments. These programs provide cash funds to cover individuals’ essential needs, making it all the more critical that beneficiaries have full and timely access to their cash benefits.

Social Security is administered by the Social Security Administration and thus is delivered in a uniform way across the United States. In contrast, TANF and Unemployment are both administered by states (and in some cases, by county administrators), leading to significant variation in program structure and delivery. TANF’s block grant structure leaves broad discretion to states to determine eligibility criteria and benefit amount.8 Unemployment is an umbrella term referring to several programs involving cash assistance payments to individuals who have lost their job.9 Federal laws and regulations provide broad guidelines on Unemployment coverage and eligibility. State laws and regulations determine specific eligibility requirements, payment amounts, and duration. In turn, this state-based discretion has resulted in essentially 53 different program implementations, though with some commonalities across programs.10

Public cash assistance is provided by direct deposit, government-administered prepaid cards, or paper checks.11 The administrator of each program decides which of these three options to offer to recipients, subject to any relevant restrictions. One such restriction that applies to the delivery of certain public benefits is the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA), implemented through Regulation E.12 EFTA generally provides, among other things, that recipients cannot be required to establish an account with a particular financial institution as a condition of receipt of a government benefit without an alternative.13 EFTA applies to both federally-administered benefits, (including Federal needs-tested programs) as well as state and local government benefits that are not needs-tested programs.14 Accordingly, distribution of federal cash assistance—such as Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, and federal tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Child Tax Credit—are subject to EFTA; recipients of cash assistance provided by these programs cannot be required to receive their funds with a specific financial institution, whether on a prepaid card or to a deposit account. Similarly, state and locally administered programs subject to EFTA include Unemployment, child support, certain prison and jail ‘‘gate money’’ benefits, and pension plan payments. In contrast, needs-tested programs administered by states to which EFTA does not apply include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

In order for a cash assistance recipient to receive their funds through direct deposit, they must be able to provide an account and routing number for an existing bank, credit union, or prepaid card account. However, a significant number of cash assistance recipients may not be able to use this option as they lack such an account. In 2021, of the households in the United States most likely to receive cash assistance—those with incomes under $30,000—an estimated 4.1 million of them lacked a bank or credit union account (i.e., are “unbanked”).15

Another common way of distributing cash assistance is through government-administered prepaid cards. The two main types of government-administered prepaid cards are the electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system and the electronic payment card (EPC) system. Benefit payments provided through EBT16 allow individuals to get their cash assistance through a network of ATMs and selected merchants that accept EBT cards, whereas EPC cards are branded as Visa or MasterCard, allowing recipients to use these cards to access cash or purchase items through any merchant that accepts those cards.17 As of July 2020, 40 states issued TANF payments via EBT, while 10 states issued TANF payments via EPC.18 To offer government-administered prepaid cards that participants can then use to make purchases and withdraw cash, program administrators contract with service providers; this market will be discussed further in Section 2.

Government-administered prepaid cards provide an important vehicle to distribute cash assistance, even in cases where it transfers only a small fraction of the overall benefits. In 2020, government-administered prepaid cards were used to distribute $409 billion in public benefits, the bulk of which was cash assistance.19 The Social Security Administration, for example, paid out approximately 4.5 percent of the Administration’s benefits on its government-administered prepaid card in 2020.20

Government-administered prepaid cards offer both advantages and disadvantages; their use can benefit government administrators and recipients alike. By reducing supplies needed and demands on employee time, cards provide cost-efficiency for administrators.21 They also present an opportunity for faster access to funds for unbanked recipients over check-cashing. However, some prepaid cards can also present substantial consumer burdens, such as costly fees to access funds, or user experience hurdles, like unresponsive customer service lines, for cash assistance recipients.

Though less frequently used, paper checks are still an option at the discretion of the agency administering public benefits. Practices vary widely from program to program. For instance, paper checks are not available to most Social Security benefits recipients.22 Further, individuals who receive Unemployment in Montana may choose to receive a paper check,23 whereas Unemployment recipients in Alabama may only receive payment by direct deposit or on their government-administered prepaid card.24 In 2020, 21 states allowed consumers to receive their TANF cash payments via paper check.25

Section 2: Barriers to accessing cash assistance

Cash assistance predominantly flows to families in need or individuals at an insecure time. Barriers to accessing that assistance, such as numerous or costly fees or inadequate customer service, can create substantial financial harm. These concerns are not limited to cash assistance provided by prepaid card, but the provision of benefits by prepaid card presents specific recurring issues. Although recipients may sometimes choose the method by which their cash assistance is delivered, in the programs the CFPB examined, recipients do not have a say in the specific prepaid card program administrators use to distribute cash assistance. This presents the potential for consumer harm because a particular prepaid card may not meet a consumer’s unique financial needs.

Fees reduce benefit amounts

Government-administered prepaid cards can have numerous or costly fees associated with their use that may exceed that of other financial products or services.26 Consumers have complained to the CFPB about service fees on their government benefits cards.27 That said, the alternatives to government-administered prepaid cards—direct deposit and paper checks—can also be a source of fees.

State agencies that offer prepaid cards execute contracts with vendors, which can represent a cost saving opportunity to states over processing paper checks repeatedly.28 The prepaid card vendors that states select earn income on cardholder29 and sometimes, interchange30 fees. This relationship structure risks potential misalignment between states’ interest in programmatic cost cutting, vendors’ interest in earning revenue, and the consumer’s desire for a safe and affordable prepaid card to meet their financial needs.

While there are potential convenience and economic advantages for recipients to using government-administered prepaid cards, those benefits may be blunted by large service fees. In 2020, for example, issuers of government-administered prepaid cards collected approximately $1.3 billion in fees.31 While this fee revenue reflects only 0.3% of the $409 billion distributed, these fees may have a significant impact on the individual consumers that pay them. Additionally, public benefits recipients may have little-to-no ability to avoid these fees due to their limited ability to choose or change their card provider; they are often locked into relationships with providers chosen by the program administrator.

Common government-administered prepaid card fees can include ATM, maintenance, balance inquiry, or customer service fees. The assessment of these fees on government-administered prepaid cards has been the subject of complaints to the CFPB, as illustrated by one consumer complaint:

“I had my unemployment compensation disbursed to the provided. Each time my benefits were debited to the account they were immediately credited back under a 'Transaction Type ' called 'RETURN UNPINNED DEPOSIT '. […] I contacted the customer service phone number for [the card] at XXXX ten times through XX/XX/XXXX- they even charged me for each phone call. There is a record of this on my statement.”32

The three largest sources of cardholder fee revenue for government-administered prepaid card providers in 2020 were ATM fees, account servicing fees, and customer service inquiry fees.33

Our review of prepaid cards issued by Unemployment programs indicates that the fees for the same service vary across states, even among states that contract with the same financial institution. For instance, Unemployment prepaid card users in some states pay up to $2 for out-of-network ATM withdrawals or up to $14 for replacements cards, while recipients in other states pay nothing for those same services.34 This is also in contrast to many credit or debit card holders who pay nothing to replace a lost or stolen card.35 Figure 1 shows the variation in out-of-network fees across states. A handful of Unemployment cards also charge in-network ATM withdrawal fees, though these fees may only apply after a certain number of free in-network transactions.36 These variations in fee schedules across states and programs are dictated by the contracts signed by program administrators with financial institutions. The range of fee structures demonstrates that program administrators may have room to negotiate better prepaid card arrangements that limit costs and provide better customer service to recipients of cash assistance.

While Unemployment payments vary from state to state, fees on these cards can represent a significant portion of a recently unemployed consumer’s temporary cash assistance.38 Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing additional payments, the “average weekly benefits were about $387 nationwide but ranged from a low of $215 in Mississippi to $550 in Massachusetts, and were only $161 in Puerto Rico.”39 At these payment levels, replacing a lost card can cost a recipient almost 4% of their average weekly benefit; $2 out-of-network ATM fees that may be relatively insignificant individually can accumulate to diminish cash assistance that is intended to provide financial stability to people who had been working but lost their jobs. As Unemployment replaces income for only a short period of time, the cumulative costs of those fees can place a significant burden on consumers during a period when they are already facing financial hardship. These fees may disrupt a recipient’s ability to pay their rent or mortgage, buy groceries, or purchase other necessities.

The CFPB has observed similar fee variations in the cards used to distribute TANF.40 Some of these EBT or EPC cards charge familiar fees such as out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees, but some programs’ cards charge recipients additional fees, such as a fee to check their account balance at an ATM,41 to call customer service,42 or to receive a “mobile balance alert.”43 Many TANF cards limit the number of free transactions available to users, even in network.44 Because recipients don’t have a choice in selecting the program’s prepaid products on which they receive their assistance, they may not always know what services are available to them, at what cost, or where they can access funds without incurring fees.

Individuals with minimal resources who rely on cash assistance for necessities can experience outsized harm from even low-dollar fees. In California in 2012, the ATM fees on TANF cards were estimated to total $19 million across approximately 450,000 recipient families, or approximately $43 per family per year.45 TANF provides modest payments to very low-income families, even when they receive the maximum monthly benefit, and that is important context in considering the impact of fees. These fees average out to $3.60 per month per family; while that is a low dollar amount, it could also represent, for example, a round trip fare on public transportation.46 These fees may also more acutely affect people who live in rural areas where it may be difficult to access in-network ATMs and users may be forced to incur out-of-network ATM fees, which are often substantially higher.

Inadequate customer service

Complaints to the CFPB about government-administered prepaid cards consistently reflect concerns about the adequacy of customer service. At its core, a functioning customer service system ensures consumers can fully utilize their funds. Full utilization includes an ability to rectify any problems with their government-administered prepaid card; consumers must be able address freezes and unauthorized charges on their financial products. Issues raised by consumers include inadequate protections against unauthorized transfers, high costs to replace a card, and insufficient or hypersensitive fraud filters that cause delays and account freezing.47 These issues intersect, and then can be exacerbated by the company’s poor customer service when consumers need help to resolve any of these issues. Inadequate customer service from prepaid card providers means that if any issue with a card arises (such as a lost card or unauthorized charges), a recipient can be without beneﬁts for weeks to months while they wait for a resolution.48

As discussed in Section 1, above, EFTA applies to the delivery of some, but not all, public benefits. Where it applies, EFTA provides specific error resolution rights and dispute procedures.49 Regardless of whether EFTA applies, prepaid card providers50 and financial institutions providing consumer financial products and services, such as government-administered prepaid cards, are subject to the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA)’s prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.51 For example, the Bureau has addressed prohibited acts and practices under the CFPA as well as under EFTA and its implementing Regulation E related to the distribution of Unemployment cash assistance in a coordinated enforcement action with the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), through which the CFPB fined Bank of America $100 million in civil money penalties. The CFPB’s order also requires Bank of America to pay eligible consumers redress related to its violations of the CFPA and Regulation E.52

The intersecting nature of customer service obstacles are present in complaints to the CFPB. One problem, such as unauthorized charges on a card, can create a cascade of problems when customer service isn’t available or responsive in a timely manner. This dynamic is illustrated by a complaint submitted to the CFPB:

“[I] noticed my account had unauthorized transactions. I called and reported it immediately and had the card shut off and claims put in for the transactions. I was told to wait for a questionnaire to fill out …The questionnaire never arrived I called in on the morning of the XXXX and was told to type a statement and include my police report of the theft with it. I did that and faxed it to them. I called back in 8 hours later to make sure they received the fax and was told my claims had been denied.”53

In fact, some consumers describe a complete inability to reach customer service representatives.54 These challenges are illustrated by another complaint submitted to the CFPB:

“I was informed … there was a total of $ XXXX dollars taken from this account by someone other than myself. … I called number after number NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE,” (emphasis in original).55

Consumers receiving multiple forms of cash assistance are often asked to use several cards to access benefits, requiring them to manage their finances and fees across different platforms. This may seem to be an inefficient system, however, until benefits recipients can access customer support when an issue arises, a single, centralized card may not be ideal for the cash assistance recipient. For example, if a recipient were to have all of their benefits on a single card and they experience any issue (theft, for example), then all beneﬁts may be cut off until the issue is resolved, which may take days, weeks, or months.

Lack of consumer choice

As a general matter, there is potential for consumer harm when cash assistance recipients do not have a meaningful choice in how they receive their payments.56 A particular product that a consumer is required to use may not meet their financial needs. Moreover, the problems described above regarding fees and customer service may be exacerbated or caused by a marketplace in which providers face minimal competitive pressure.

As discussed in Section 1, above, consumer financial protection laws require consumer choice for certain cash assistance payments. EFTA, where it applies, prohibits financial institutions or other persons from requiring consumers to receive payments on a specific prepaid card with no alternative options.57 In October 2021, the Bureau took action against prison financial services company JPay for, among other things, violating EFTA and Regulation E when consumers in certain states were required to receive a government benefit owed to them at the time of their release from prison or jail on a JPay prepaid debit card.58

Even for benefits programs protected by EFTA and Regulation E, consumers that choose to receive their benefits by prepaid card do not have a choice in which company is selected by the government to provide the card. Instead, states develop contracts with a specific provider. Consumers therefore are not able to choose a product with terms or features that meets their specific needs. Because the consumer is the end-user of the cash assistance but does not select the product for disbursement and cannot switch to a different product, providers have reduced incentives to prioritize product quality and ease of use. Moreover, there is a risk that companies will take unfair advantage of recipients who are locked into a relationship with that particular provider, such as by charging complicated or large service fees.

Although some program administrators may prioritize consumer needs in the contracting process, consumer needs are not inherently part of product selection. Further, program administrators may not be fully aware of barriers to access to funds, and they may not be able to fully account for different needs among diverse groups of consumers.

Currently, the vendor marketplace offering governments prepaid cards is limited to a small number of providers. According to the CFPB’s analysis, only six banks contract with states for Unemployment government-administered prepaid cards. While four companies were under contract to provide EBT cards to states in 2022, just two companies held more than 95% of the EBT contracts.59 Within this limited marketplace, companies may face limited competitive pressure in the contracting process even if program administrators are aware of and prioritize consumer needs. The limited provider marketplace itself may be a result of operating requirements set by program administrators and customer use case. These and other factors could place pressure on some providers to generate expected revenue.

Further, programs that technically offer a choice about how benefits may be received may fail to make the options clear to the consumer or to provide access to them.60 Where EFTA applies, under Regulation E certain disclosures about payment options are required.61 Nonetheless, one consumer complained to the CFPB about their Unemployment payments being directed to a prepaid card against their wishes:

“I never used this card because I did not request it. When I completed my initial unemployment application, I requested direct deposit. 5 weeks of unemployment insurance money totaling {$1800.00} was sent to this card. […] The [agency] when I went to their office after emailing them for months & no response to my emails only confirmed the amounts and when the money was sent each week to the card. I am frustrated that no one is doing their job.”62

Additionally, how programs present options to consumers may have a significant effect on what payment method consumers select. For example, one state includes a link to sign up for direct deposit on the login page for its prepaid card.63 Other states do not present payment alternatives as clearly or accessibly. Research shows that even minor differences in application forms and sign-up processes can have dramatic effects on people's behavior.64

Conclusion and next steps

Public benefits programs offering cash assistance provide an important financial safety net to millions of low-income families and individuals at financially precarious points in their lives. Safe and efficient delivery of these benefits is essential, as it allows individuals to effectively manage their financial lives.

Cash assistance recipients are sometimes offered—or assigned—costly or inaccessible financial products on which they receive their benefits. There are relatively few vendors in the marketplace for government-administered prepaid cards, and the consumer is the end-user of the benefits but has little-to-no input on product selection. These factors may minimize the competitive forces that can improve financial products or services. There is also a risk that companies are not motivated to improve their products because they don’t have a direct relationship with the end user consumers who are locked into a relationship with the provider selected by program administrators. These challenges ultimately undermine the financial well-being of cash assistance recipients by siphoning government funds from eligible individuals and redirecting government dollars to financial institutions.

Cash assistance recipients should be protected from financial harm just like any other consumer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is committed to making sure entities subject to federal consumer financial laws—including those involved in the delivery of cash assistance—comply with their obligations. Specifically, the CFPB will monitor and, when appropriate, take action against entities that violate the federal consumer financial laws with respect to the delivery of cash assistance.

The CFPB is sharing this Issue Spotlight with federal and state agencies that administer public benefits programs to support efforts to increase competition or otherwise address the issues raised in this Spotlight. To ensure that cash assistance recipients get the full benefit of the funds made available to them, program administrators may want to consider changes to their benefits delivery systems to increase safety, minimize fees, improve customer service, and increase choice and competition.

Endnotes
Public benefits programs generally use the term “cash assistance” for a narrower range of means-tested cash programs. This Issue Spotlight broadens that category to include all public benefits programs that provide cash, rather than near-cash or in-kind benefits. This Issue Spotlight analyzes recurring cash payments that fall under both social welfare and social insurance public benefits programs.
In addition to recurring public benefits payments, even more Americans receive broad cash assistance payments during national emergencies, such as COVID Economic Impact Payments (EIP).6F Congress issued three rounds of EIP to consumers, subject to income limits: EIP1 under the CARES Act; EIP2 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA); and EIP3 under the American Rescue Plan Act. The IRS distributed these payments to consumers, based on information they provided on Federal tax returns, generally through direct deposit to their deposit accounts of record or through physical checks.
Examples of “near cash” benefits are Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which allow discretionary spending but only on approved items at credentialed retailers, or Section 8 vouchers.
Examples of in-kind benefits include apartments in a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-funded Housing Authority, or free Covid-19 tests distributed by the U.S. Postal Service.

Analysis of Deposit Insurance Coverage on Funds Stored Through Payment Apps

By the CFPB Office of Competition and Innovation and Office of Markets – JUN 01, 2023

SHARE & PRINT

In recent years, transaction volumes on payment apps have substantially increased. For example, total person-to-person (P2P) payment dollar volume quadrupled between 2018 and 2022.1 Importantly, many U.S. consumers and businesses are not simply using these services to transfer funds. They are also storing billions of dollars through these services outside of their federally insured bank or credit union accounts. Indeed, the companies offering many of these widely used services have a strong financial incentive to encourage users to keep their funds stored rather than automatically sweeping them back into linked bank or credit union accounts.

There has been significant public attention paid recently to the safety and stability of stored funds, particularly when it comes to fast-growing financial firms. In 2022, the collapse of crypto asset platforms FTX and Voyager led to significant harms to platform consumers who lost hundreds of millions of dollars, in addition to their crypto assets.2 Following the demise this year of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank, and First Republic Bank, the public has learned more about the importance of federal deposit insurance coverage.3 Additional concerns arise with the growth and attendant risks of non-traditional financial services platforms. These events have spurred renewed attention on the varied types of financial institutions consumers use and the extent to which consumers’ funds at those financial institutions are protected from losses.

This issue spotlight analyzes the extent to which popular payment apps, sometimes described as P2P payment platforms, claim to provide federal deposit insurance coverage to users through business arrangements with banks or credit unions.4 While the primary purpose of these quickly growing platforms is to allow consumers and businesses to send and receive money, payment app companies offer an increasing array of services alongside this function, including the ability for consumers to store funds. We find that stored funds can be at risk of loss in the event of financial distress or failure of the entity operating the nonbank payment platform, and often are not placed in an account at a bank or credit union and lack individual deposit insurance coverage.5

The growth of payment apps to transfer funds and perform other services

Payments generally involve transfers of monetary value from a payer to a receiver, or payee. There are many ways to effectuate a payment, such as via cards (including credit, debit, and prepaid), ACH (Automated Clearing House), checks, wire transfers, and cash.

Payment systems vary by the network operating rules and guidance that define transaction processes. There are two major payment types: “push” and “pull.” In push transactions, the payer initiates the payment, instructing their bank to debit funds from their account and send it to the receiver’s account. Examples of these types of payments include checks, wires, and payroll. By contrast, pull transactions are initiated by the receiver, who instructs their bank to pull or withdraw funds from the payer's bank. Pull or debit payments are often used for recurring payments like bill pay.

There are also two types of payment systems: “open loop” and “closed loop.” Bank transfer systems operate as an open loop system where banks act as intermediaries between the end parties (payer and receiver) and the system, and transactions are enabled between accounts at different banks. A person with an account at one bank can send funds to a business that has an account at a different bank. In open loop systems, network rules bind the direct participation of banks, and transactions are sent in compliance with relevant network rules.

In closed loop systems, transactions are enabled through a single provider. Under this model, both payer and receiver must have an account with the same provider to complete the payment. In a transaction, the single provider will reduce the funds in the account of the payer and increase the funds in the account of the receiver. Funds do not leave the system in this type of transaction. Closed loop payment systems are often connected to traditional open loop systems, so funds can be deposited into or withdrawn out of the closed loop system. Often, nonbank participants use this model because they don’t have the same level of access to core payments rails as banks.

As e-commerce rapidly accelerated in the late 1990s, many online merchants were searching for payment solutions to accept funds from customers. Digital payment solutions emerged to help these online merchants process sales. Many firms obtained licenses from individual states to engage in money services businesses, which are typically licensed for offering remittances and other money transfers.

These companies now often provide mobile apps and standard functions—like sending money to friends or transferring funds to a bank account—to consumers for free. They generate revenue in various other ways, that include—but are by no means limited to—charging merchants to accept payments through the platform; charging consumers for additional features (e.g., expediting the transfer of funds to their bank accounts, buying and selling crypto assets, using a credit card to send payments, etc.); and through ancillary products and services. Companies offering stored value services can also make money from interest generated by investing funds their customers store on the app, subject to applicable law.

As the desire for speed and the ability to send payments digitally has grown, so too has consumers’ adoption of these payment methods for a variety of purposes, such as splitting a restaurant check, paying rent, or making a purchase at a garage sale. Over three-quarters of U.S. adults have used at least one type of payment app.6 Younger consumers’ adoption of these services is especially prevalent: 85 percent of consumers aged 18 to 29 have used such a service.7 Last year, transaction volume across all service providers was estimated at approximately $893 billion, and it may reach nearly $1.6 trillion by 2027.8

There are two main types of payment solutions that have important distinctions from one another. The first method is where banks and credit unions establish mechanisms through an app or another financial institution interface so that customers can transfer funds to other customers within the same bank or at other banks.9 Because this is designed as a bank transfer product, there is no ability to store a balance outside of consumers’ existing bank accounts.

The issue spotlight focuses on the other type of payment solution, which is offered by nonbanks (such as PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App) through applications on mobile devices.10 To send funds, a consumer opens an account with one of these app providers and then links a payment method, such as a bank account, debit card, credit card, stored value account, or prepaid card. Consumers can then send funds from that linked payment method to another person who must also have an account with that payment app to receive them. Typically, any payments a consumer receives using a payment app are stored on that platform or an associated stored value account until the consumer affirmatively requests a transfer of those funds out of this closed loop system and into their bank account or prepaid card.

While the core service of nonbank payment platforms is to provide a mechanism to send funds from one person to another, these apps also facilitate a growing set of related financial products and services, including offering debit cards, credit cards, “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) loans, international remittances, and crypto asset transactions. In addition to these features, many payment apps—including PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, Apple Pay, and Google Pay—also offer stored value accounts that consumers can use as another payment method, and as a place to hold funds received from a payment or loaded into the account. (Meta’s offering, Meta Pay, is unique in that it currently does not offer stored value services.) While banks and credit unions are required to provide detailed information on their total deposits on a regular basis, these entities currently have no such requirement under federal law.11 However, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) estimates that U.S. consumers have billions of dollars stored on these nonbank payment apps.12

Funds stored in payment apps often lack deposit insurance

Historically, banks and credit unions have been the major providers of banking services like taking deposits, facilitating payments, and lending money—activities that are critically important to the overall financial system and broader economy.13 As such, these institutions are publicly chartered and subject to a federal regulatory regime. One part of this regime is the FDIC deposit insurance system, which protects depositors at FDIC-insured banks against the loss of their insured deposits up to at least $250,000 if their bank fails; a similar insurance framework is administered by the National Credit Union Administration to protect deposits at credit unions.14

Protecting small depositors, who hold most of the deposit accounts, has been an objective of the deposit insurance system since its founding. However, as the market for financial services has evolved, it is not always clear to consumers when they are dealing directly with a bank or with a nonbank. As a result, consumers may not fully appreciate when, or under what conditions, they would be protected by deposit insurance.15

For example, as noted above, payment apps now offer consumers access to certain products and services traditionally provided by banks, including payment transfers and stored value services that closely resemble deposit accounts.16 While consumers may perceive a stored value account as functioning like a traditional deposit account, there are significant distinctions. Deposit insurance coverage would only apply to funds which are held on deposit at an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA insured credit union in the unlikely event of a failure. If the consumers’ funds have not been deposited into an account at the bank or credit union, then those funds would not be eligible for deposit insurance coverage.

For instance, some payment app companies invest users’ funds in loans and bonds. The company profits, in part, by earning money on these investments and generally paying no interest on users’ balances. Thus, the payment app companies have a strong financial incentive to keep customer funds on the platform and not automatically sweep them back to the customer’s linked bank or credit union account.

User agreements for these payment apps are often confusing, murky, or even silent on exactly where consumer funds are being held or invested, whether and under what conditions they are insured at a partner bank, and what would happen if the payment app company or the entity holding the funds were to fail.17

Some nonbank payment app firms do not offer accounts that may be eligible for deposit insurance. And even if a nonbank entity claims to hold its customers’ funds on deposit at an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union in a manner consistent with the respective agency’s regulations on pass-through deposit insurance, such a claim is extremely difficult to verify before a bank or credit union fails. In fact, ultimately, the FDIC or NCUA in its role as bank or credit union receiver determines if conditions stated in its pass-through regulations have been satisfied, but that determination is made only after a failure. While a bank or credit union is open and operating, if a nonbank payment app requests customers’ personally identifiable information as part of registering a prepaid card, for example, that is a helpful initial step to satisfying the relevant pass-through regulations. However, other regulatory conditions apply.

In addition to an agency’s regulatory conditions for pass-through insurance, some nonbank payment apps place pre-conditions on their products. For example, some entities advertise deposit insurance through business arrangements with a bank or credit union for consumers who obtain a payment app company-branded card or opt to have some or all of their paycheck directly deposited into the account. In all cases, though, deposit insurance only protects against the failure of the bank or credit union and does not protect the customer against the failure of the nonbank company itself.18

Licensing and regulatory requirements

As companies engaged in money transfer services, nonbank payment app companies are often regulated as money services businesses (MSBs) subject to federal and state regulation.30 To the extent they qualify as MSBs under federal law, nonbank payment app companies must register with the U.S. Department of Treasury,31 but they are not subject to ongoing supervision for safety and soundness by federal prudential regulators like traditional depository institutions.

At the state level, MSBs are generally subject to licensing requirements and “safety and soundness requirements, including net worth, bonding, and permissible investments.”32 Relevant here, “permissible investments” refers to the types of financial instruments where MSBs can invest their customers’ funds. Restrictions on these investment types vary by state, with some states allowing MSBs to invest funds in potentially risky publicly traded securities or accounts receivable, and some states imposing no restrictions at all.33

Other states restrict MSB investments to relatively safe assets, but as evidenced by recent bank failures, even those assets can lose value and cause disruptions. Most MSB laws were designed with companies like Western Union or MoneyGram in mind, traditional firms that did not maintain customers’ funds for more than a few days.34 For example, a consumer receiving money from a relative may have those inbound funds in their account for a brief period of time before they are able to withdraw them from a storefront. Customers using payment apps may maintain balances for far longer than a few days and may functionally use the account as a bank or credit union account substitute.35

Certain states, and state regulatory coordinating bodies, are working to strengthen state money transmitter laws, though the framework does not include such protections for consumers as mandatory deposit insurance or automatic balance sweeps back into a linked insured account.36

Implications for consumers

Funds stored in a payment app may be at significantly higher risk of loss for a consumer than if it is deposited in an insured bank or credit union account. For instance, nonbank payment apps that invest customer funds in securities or other non-deposit products expose the company to the risk of insolvency if the investments’ value declines. The companies are also exposed to risk if customers demand their funds all at once. If a nonbank payment app was to go bankrupt as a result of these risks, customers may not be the only creditors with claims on the company’s remaining assets. Even if consumers do not ultimately lose any funds, they may face significant delays in accessing their funds while the bankruptcy process unfolds.

The varying preconditions required by nonbank payment apps based on which types of products and services consumers opt for when storing funds may amplify consumer confusion.37 Cognizant of this blurring, in May 2022, the CFPB issued a Circular regarding deceptive representations involving the FDIC’s name or logo or deposit insurance.38 Similarly, the FDIC has observed an increasing number of instances where financial services providers or other entities or individuals have misused the FDIC’s name or logo or have made false or misleading representations about deposit insurance.39 In addition, in December 2022, the FDIC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking to update rules regarding FDIC signage, such as a proposal to require banks to display digital FDIC signs on their website and mobile apps, including clear notifications on relevant pages where uninsured products are offered.

Consumers should be aware of these risks if they choose to leave a balance on these nonbank payment apps. To minimize these risks, consumers may choose to transfer their nonbank payment app balances back to their federally insured deposit accounts, where they have a direct relationship with an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union. The CFPB, in coordination with other state and federal regulators, will continue to monitor the evolution of this segment of the payments ecosystem and consider whether further steps should be taken to protect consumers.

PayPal users can receive money to their PayPal account if they have not opened a PayPal Balance account, but PayPal specifies that these funds “cannot be held as a balance in your personal account” and that they “represent unsecured claims against PayPal that are not eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance.” Users may transfer this money out of the account (e.g., to a linked bank account or debit card, or to a PayPal Balance account) but cannot otherwise use the funds or add to the account.

Otherwise, any funds in the user’s PayPal Balance account “represent unsecured claims against PayPal that are not eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance.” In addition, when PayPal provides “immediate or early credit of funds sent to your Balance Account, there might be a delay between the time that funds are credited and when we actually transfer those funds to one of the custodial accounts. That amount might not be eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance in your name during this period, but we will still hold the funds as your agent and custodian in investments authorized by our state regulators.” See PayPal Balance Terms and Conditions (last updated May 17, 2023), https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/pp-balance-tnc  (section on “Holding Funds in Your Balance Account”). Note that the crypto assets are not FDIC-insured, and PayPal’s terms specify that customers with a crypto asset balance “do not own any specific, identifiable, Crypto Asset.” Rather, the balance “represents your ownership of the amount of each type of Crypto Asset shown,” which PayPal combines “with the Crypto Asset balances of other PayPal accountholders and holds those Crypto Assets in one or more omnibus accounts, directly or with a Service Provider.” See PayPal Cryptocurrency Terms and Conditions (last updated Dec. 14, 2022), https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/cryptocurrencies-tnc  (section on “Holding Crypto Assets in your Cryptocurrencies Hub”).

Navient, Formerly Part of Sallie Mae, Illegally Cheated Borrowers Out of Repayment Rights Through Shortcuts and Deception

JAN 18, 2017
SHARE & PRINT

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is suing the nation’s largest servicer of both federal and private student loans for systematically and illegally failing borrowers at every stage of repayment. For years, Navient, formerly part of Sallie Mae, created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans. The Bureau seeks to recover significant relief for the borrowers harmed by these illegal servicing failures.

""For years, Navient failed consumers who counted on the company to help give them a fair chance to pay back their student loans,"" said CFPB Director Richard Cordray. ""At every stage of repayment, Navient chose to shortcut and deceive consumers to save on operating costs. Too many borrowers paid more for their loans because Navient illegally cheated them and today's action seeks to hold them accountable.""

Formerly part of Sallie Mae, Inc., Navient is the largest student loan servicer in the United States. It services the loans of more than 12 million borrowers, including more than 6 million accounts under its contract with the Department of Education. Altogether, it services more than $300 billion in federal and private student loans. Named in today’s lawsuit are Navient Corporation and two of its subsidiaries: Navient Solutions is a division responsible for loan servicing operations; Pioneer Credit Recovery specializes in the collection of defaulted student loans.

Servicers are a critical link between borrowers and lenders. They manage borrowers’ accounts, process monthly payments, and communicate directly with borrowers. When facing unemployment or other financial hardship, borrowers rely on their student loan servicer to help them enroll in alternative repayment plans or request a modification of loan terms. A servicer is often different from the lender, and borrowers typically have no control over which company is assigned to service their loans.

Starting in 2009, the vast majority of federal student loan borrowers gained a right to make payments based on how much money they earn by enrolling in repayment arrangements known as income-driven repayment plans. These plans are part of the federal government’s effort to make student loans more affordable. For borrowers who meet certain income and family-size criteria, these plans can offer monthly payments as low as zero dollars. Another important benefit of income-driven repayment plans is that for the first three years after enrollment, many consumers are entitled to have the federal government pay part of the interest charges if they can’t keep up. All federal student loan borrowers enrolled in these plans may be eligible for loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of monthly payments.

In today’s action, the Bureau alleges that Navient has failed to provide the most basic functions of adequate student loan servicing at every stage of repayment for both private and federal loans. Navient provided bad information in writing and over the phone, processed payments incorrectly, and failed to act when borrowers complained about problems. Critically, it systematically made it harder for borrowers to obtain the important right to pay according to what they can afford. These illegal practices made paying back student loans more difficult and costly for certain borrowers. Specifically, among the allegations in today’s lawsuit, the Bureau charges that Navient:

Fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts: As soon as a borrower begins to pay back their loans, student loan servicers are supposed to take a borrower’s payment and follow instructions from the borrower about how to apply it across their multiple loans. Navient repeatedly misapplies or misallocates payments — often making the same error multiple times over many months. The company all too often fails to correct its errors unless a consumer discovers the problem and contacts the company.

Steers struggling borrowers toward paying more than they have to on loans: When borrowers run into trouble repaying their federal student loans, they have a right under federal law to apply for repayment plans that allow for a lower monthly payment. But the Bureau believes that Navient steers many borrowers into forbearance, an option designed to let borrowers take a short break from making payments. But interest continues to add up during forbearance. Certain consumers with subsidized loans end up paying a heavy price because they could have potentially avoided those interest charges. From January 2010 to March 2015, the company added up to $4 billion in interest charges to the principal balances of borrowers who were enrolled in multiple, consecutive forbearances. The Bureau believes that a large portion of these charges could have been avoided had Navient followed the law.

Obscured information consumers needed to maintain their lower payments: Borrowers who successfully enroll in an income-driven repayment plan need to recertify their income and family size annually. But Navient’s emails and annual renewal notice sent to borrowers failed to adequately inform them of critical deadlines or the consequences if they failed to act. Navient also obscured its renewal notices in emails sent to borrowers that did not adequately alert them about the need to renew. Many borrowers did not renew their enrollment on time and they lost their affordable monthly payments, which could have caused their monthly payments to jump by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. When that happens, accrued interest is added to the borrower’s principal balance, and these borrowers may have lost other protections, including interest subsidies and progress toward loan forgiveness.

Deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan: Navient told borrowers that they could apply for co-signer release if they made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments. Even though it permits borrowers to prepay monthly installments in advance and tells customers who do prepay that they can skip upcoming payments, when borrowers did so, Navient reset the counter on the number of consecutive payments they made to zero. So borrowers who tried to get ahead of their loans and prepay would have been denied co-signer release and had to start over.

Harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans: Student loan payments are reported to credit reporting companies. Severely and permanently disabled borrowers with federal student loans, including veterans whose disability is connected to their military service, have a right to seek loan forgiveness under the federal Total and Permanent Disability discharge program. Navient misreported to the credit reporting companies that borrowers who had their loans discharged under this program had defaulted on their loans when they had not. This potentially caused damage to their credit reports.                                       


The Bureau also alleges that Navient, through its subsidiary Pioneer, made illegal misrepresentations relating to the federal loan rehabilitation program available to defaulted borrowers. Pioneer misrepresented the effect of completing the federal loan rehabilitation program by falsely stating or implying that doing so would remove all adverse information about the defaulted loan from the borrower’s credit report. Pioneer also misrepresented the collection fees that would be forgiven upon completion of the program.

Today’s lawsuit alleges that Navient has been in violation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. The suit seeks redress for consumers harmed by Navient’s illegal practices. The CFPB is also seeking to keep Navient from continuing the illegal conduct described in the complaint, and to prevent new borrowers from being harmed.

The complaint against Navient Corporation, Navient Solutions, and Pioneer Credit Recovery is available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201701_cfpb_Navient-Pioneer-Credit-Recovery-complaint.pdf 

This action comes as the Bureau takes steps to ensure that all student loan borrowers have access to adequate student loan servicing. In 2015, the Bureau released a report outlining widespread servicing failures reported by both federal and private student loan borrowers and also published a framework for student loan servicing reforms. As part of this work, the Bureau has continually raised concerns around illegal student loan servicing practices. The Bureau has called for market-wide reforms and prioritized taking action against companies that engage in illegal servicing practices.

Student loans make up the nation’s second largest consumer debt market. Today there are more than 44 million federal and private student loan borrowers and collectively these consumers owe roughly $1.4 trillion. In a study last year, the CFPB found that more than 8 million borrowers are in default on more than $130 billion in student loans, a problem that may be driven by breakdowns in student loan servicing. Students and their families can find help on how to tackle their student debt on the CFPB’s website. Student loan borrowers experiencing problems related to repaying student loans or debt collection can also submit a complaint to the CFPB.

More information is available at consumerfinance.gov/students.

The Bureau’s complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has actually violated the law.

If you’re struggling to keep up with credit card bills, you’re not alone. According to a 2017 Bureau report, from 2015 to 2017 overall credit card debt increased by 13 percent, while people with very low credit scores saw their debt rise by 22 percent. 

Even if you’ve hit a rough spot, lost your job, are dealing with family illness, or facing emergencies, you still have options. The earlier you act on those options, the better your chances are for avoiding a debt in collections, damage to your credit report, a potential lawsuit or bankruptcy.   

Address your credit card debt with your credit card company

Contact your credit card company. When you think you might miss a credit card payment, or you already have, contact your credit card company as soon as possible. Many will work with you to find a repayment plan that suits your current situation. Once you’re late or miss a payment, you’re considered delinquent. If you don’t pay, the credit card company may block your ability to use your credit card and report the delinquency to the credit reporting companies. Generally, that delinquency can stay on your credit report for up to seven years. You could also face debt collection and be sued.

Find out what repayment options your credit card company offers. Credit card companies can, and often do, provide alternative repayment options. They depend on, among other factors, your income, how much you can afford to pay, and the amount you owe. They offer loss mitigation programs, sometimes called forbearance or hardship programs. Often these programs let you postpone a set number of monthly payments or pay a lower monthly payment at a reduced interest rate, until you repay the balance in full. If the credit card company determines that you cannot afford a full repayment plan within a certain timeframe, you might be able to negotiate to settle the debt for an amount lower than what you owe. This would depend upon the company’s policies and your account-specific circumstances. Remember to get written confirmation of any alternative repayment option to which you agree.  

Debt settlement companies are typically for-profit companies that often state that they can negotiate with your credit card company to reduce the amount you owe. Credit card companies generally do not have special offers available to only debt settlement firms, so you are paying the debt settlement company for work that you can do yourself. Typically, the debt settlement company will ask you to stop any payment and will ask you to stop communicating directly with your credit card company. Stopping payments might have a negative impact on your creditworthiness that you could avoid by working directly with the credit card company. Stopping payments could also result in a lawsuit being filed against you by the credit card company or a debt collector.  

Debt settlement companies charge fees–often 20 to 25 percent (or more) of the settled debt. You may face additional fees as well. You should carefully review all the terms and conditions of the debt settlement company’s fees and know your rights . For example, it’s illegal for companies that sell debt settlement and other debt relief services on the phone to charge a fee before settling your debt. 

Also, while credit card companies’ own loss mitigation policies are available to all eligible consumers, according to the 2017 Bureau report, often credit card companies will not work with debt settlement companies.

Comparing Costs: Debt settlement company vs. Credit card company

To better understand the difference between working directly with your credit card company and working with a debt settlement company, let’s take an example of a $10,000 credit card balance that is more than 120 days past due. This example assumes the credit card company would agree to a 60 percent settlement on a $10,000 debt, meaning you pay $6,000 plus any fees if you work with a debt settlement company.

Working with debt settlement company	Working with your credit card company


You’ll generally pay about 20 percent (or more) of your balance in fees, or $2,000.

$10,000 debt owed

−$4,000 debt forgiven

	

You could settle this debt without any debt settlement fees.

$10,000 debt owed

−$4,000 debt forgiven




$6,000

+$2,000 debt settlement fee

	

$6,000




Total amount paid = $8,000

Money saved: $2,000

	

Total amount paid = $6,000

Money saved: $4,000

Another, less visible cost of working with a debt settlement company that has you stop payment on your debt is the potential negative impact to your creditworthiness. When you contract with a debt settlement company, your balance often is not negotiated down and settled right away. This also means that your balance could continue to grow with additional interest and late fees if you stop payments to the credit card company on the instructions of the debt settlement company. 

Working with a credit counselor

Depending on your situation, you may wish to contact a credit counselor. Credit counselors can help you manage your money, pay off your debt, and work with you to achieve your financial goals. They may have you make payments on your debt over a longer period, generally at a lower interest rate. They can also simplify the repayment process by allowing you to make one payment each month for all the loans you enroll in their debt management plan. There may be a fee for a debt management program.

Credit counseling agencies are usually nonprofit organizations, and you can find them through an internet search. To get started, you can try the Financial Counseling Association of America , or by phone at (800) 450-1794, or the National Foundation for Credit Counseling , or by phone at (800) 388-2227.

It’s always a good time to give your student debt repayment plan a check-up. Regardless of your situation, there are some basic steps you can take to avoid stress and save money in the long run.

Understand what makes student loans unique

Student loan interest begins to accrue after the loans are issued, and borrowers can expect to pay more than they originally borrowed. But student loans also have some unique traits, and understanding these can help you make more informed financial decisions.

How does interest work with student loans
Interest accrues daily, in most cases starting the day your loans are disbursed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government will pay your interest while your loans are in a deferred status – for example, while you are in still enrolled at least half time in school or in your six-month, post-school grace period. The government also will pay your interest when your loans are placed in deferment due to a return to at least half-time enrollment in college, economic hardship, unemployment, cancer treatment, or military deployment. Whether you have a subsidized loan or unsubsidized federal loan, you will be responsible for the interest that accrues during a forbearance.
Depending on the type of loan, unpaid interest may be capitalized after a period of deferment or forbearance, meaning that it will be added to your loan principal balance when you resume making payments. In other words you will pay interest on interest.
For Direct Loans and other federally-owned loans, interest is capitalized after a deferment on an unsubsidized loan or if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest that accrues during a forbearance, while you are in school or in the post-school grace period is no longer capitalized into the principal balance of your Federal Direct Loans.
If you have certain, older federal loans that are not owned by the federal government, interest may capitalize after the post-school grace period or a deferment on an unsubsidized loan, after certain types of forbearance, or, if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in an example. Suppose you borrow $10,000 for your last year of school, at an annual interest rate of 3.65%, with repayment starting exactly 1 year after you get your loan funds.

With a daily interest rate of 0.01% (3.65% ÷ 365), you will accrue $1 in interest each day, for a total of $365 by the day repayment starts.
If you don’t pay off the $365 before repayment starts, then it will capitalize. Your principal will increase to $10,365, and your daily interest will go up to $1.0365.
If you stay on Standard Repayment Plan, with ten years of equal monthly payments, you will pay about $103 a month, with about $17 going to interest.
But suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR) and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account, causing your loan balance to grow. This is negative amortization.
Negative amortization happens when the total amount you owe increases as you repay your loan if you’re not paying off your interest each month. Your interest charges will be added to the amount you owe, causing your loan to grow over time. This can occur if you are in a deferment for an unsubsidized loan or if you have an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and your payments are not large enough to cover the monthly accruing interest.

Interest under the SAVE repayment plan

Learn more about additional SAVE plan benefits that will go into effect in 2024 .

Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in a couple examples.

The first example illustrates how much interest can accrue before repayment begins. Suppose you borrow $10,000 under an Unsubsidized Direct Loan for your last year of school at an annual interest rate of 3.65%. Repayment will start exactly one year after your loan is fully disbursed. In this example, you receive half the loan amount on September 1st and second half on January 1st.

The second example shows how interest accrues during repayment. In this case, you have $10,000 in Subsidized Direct Loans when you leave school. You were not charged any interest while in school or the grace period. The interest rate on these loans during your repayment period is 3.65%.

If you enroll in a standard repayment plan, with equal monthly payments over ten years, you will pay about $100 a month for 120 months. During your first year of repayment, about $350 of those payments will go to interest.
However, suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR), other than the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account. This will cause your loan balance to grow rather than shrink, even though you’re making regular payments. This is negative amortization.
How do payments and credit reporting work with student loans?
The best way to protect your credit is to always make your payments on time and in full.
When you make a payments, it is applied to fees, then interest, and then principal. Extra payments can save you time and interest. No late fees are charged for loans owned by the Department of Education (ED).
Each loan you receive appears on your credit report as a separate account. Your payments will be recorded this way too, even if you’re making a single payment to one servicer.
When your loan is report delinquent depends on whether it’s a private or federal student loan.
Private student loans may be reported delinquent as early as 30 days without a payment.
Federal loans owned commercially in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program are considered delinquent at day 60.
Federal loans (Direct and FFEL) owned by ED are reported delinquent at day 90 of no payment.
What happens if I miss a student loan payment?
The first day after you miss a payment due date, your loan becomes delinquent.

UPDATE! U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced a one-time temporary program that offers benefits to borrowers with federally-owned student loans who fall behind on their payments during the first 12 months following the end of the pandemic payment pause. From October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, missed monthly payments on your federally owned student loans will not be reported to credit reporting companies, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. The Department of Education has directed its servicers to apply administrative forbearances to accounts that become delinquent during the on-ramp.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about this temporary “on ramp” period .

After the on-ramp period ends, accounts that become at least 90 days delinquent will be reported to the nationwide credit reporting agencies. Borrowers who continue to miss payments risk defaulting on their federal loans.

When does default occur?
If you continue to miss payments, your loan will eventually enter default. For most federal loans, this occurs after 270 days, or approximately 9 months, although loans are not reported to be in default until they reach the 360th day of delinquency and are sent to collections. Banks and other private lenders typically charge-off private education loans when they become 120 days past due, but charge-off rules vary by lender.
A default note will go on your credit report, which can have a negative impact on your credit score.
Once your loan is in default, the lender can file a lawsuit against you to collect on the debt. This is because student loans are unsecured debt, which means there is no collateral to repossess, such as a car or house.
Defaulting on a federal student loan can have additional consequences. You could lose your eligibility for all federal student aid and face garnishment of your federal tax returns, wages, and Social Security payments.
However, typically there are other options for getting out of default. If you are struggling to afford your student loan payments, reach out to your servicer immediately to ask about your options. Reliable lenders will want to work with you to help you get out of default.
Federal loans offer rehabilitation and consolidation.
Private lenders may be willing to negotiate a deal with you.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about the Fresh Start Initiative .

How can I get rid of my student loans?

Outside of repaying your loans in full, ED offers multiple options for loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge  for your federal student loans.

There are options available for paying off your private student loans. Contact your private loan lender to determine what option is best for you.

Borrowers who expect to be incarcerated for at least 10 years should inform their loan servicer.

Take control of your loans

Now that you understand the ins and outs of your loans, let’s go over some strategies for getting them paid off as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Know what you owe. Make a list of your student loans. Include whether they’re private or federal, monthly payment and due date, the current and principal balances, the interest rates, and servicer. If you’re not sure, start by checking your free credit report . For federal loans, it will also help to know what type of loan it is (such as PLUS, subsidized, or unsubsidized) and the name of your repayment plan. You can look up your federal loans at studentaid.gov  .

See if your loans fit into your budget and pay schedule. Make a budget and explore strategies for reducing debt to help you see how your student loans fit into your finances. Request a different due date if that would make it easier for you to make your payments on time and in full.

Make sure your federal repayment plan is the best one for you. You can use Education Department’s Loan Simulator  to compare plans by monthly payment, total interest, and more.

Save yourself time and money

Set up direct debit (aka autopay) for 0.25% off your interest rate. With direct debt, your payment is taken automatically from your bank account each month.  All federal direct loans and many private lenders offer this discount.

Extra payments  can get you out of debt faster and save you money on interest—if you can afford them. To get the full benefit, tell your servicer to apply extra payments to your highest interest rate loan(s) first. 

Stay in touch with your servicer. Make sure your servicer has your current mailing address, phone number, and email address. Open their mail and answer their calls so you find out about problems quickly, before consequences snowball.

Keep good records. Save all the mail from your servicer. Take notes when you talk on the phone with them: jot down the date, the name of the person you’re talking to, what you asked, and how they answered.

Claim your student loan interest on your tax return. Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be able to claim up to $2,500 of the student loan interest you paid in a given year.

If your payment is too high, seek income-driven repayment rather than a pause on payments. Pauses, known as deferment and forbearance, are not long-term solutions. Interest continues to accrue during forbearance for all federal loans and during deferment for unsubsidized loans, which could make them more expensive than enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, especially the new SAVE plan .

Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)

NEW: Visit ED’s website to learn more about the new one-time income-driven repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and see if you qualify .

An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Use ED’s Loan Simulator to choose the right plan for you. 

Learn about SAVE, the newest IDR plan, and how to enroll. The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history. It may provide you with the lowest monthly payments and reduced times to getting loan forgiveness if you borrowed a small loan. Also, under the SAVE plan, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover the accrued interest, that interest will not be charged to you. Instead, it will be forgiven, meaning your loan balance will not grow. Visit ED’s website to learn more about SAVE and how to enroll .

Automate your IDR recertification. Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans must annually recertify their income and household size. As part of the FUTURE Act, you can provide consent to ED to automatically recertify your IDR payment based on information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By consenting, you allow ED to receive your tax return information and your monthly payment will be automatically adjusted without you having to recertify each subsequent year. If your income has changed from your most-recent tax return, you can always submit additional documentation to have your monthly payment reviewed.

Set a reminder to renew your paperwork. If you don’t consent to the automatic recertification, you will need to confirm your income annually in order to keep your payment based on your income. Failure to recertify will likely result in a significant increase in your monthly payment amount. It can also result in interest capitalization.

Renew your IDR income recertification early if your income goes down or your household grows. Your monthly payment will be recalculated. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof) you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment  (IDR) plan.

Beware of capitalization. For federal student loans, interest will be capitalized – or added to your principal – under two circumstances: when you exit a period of deferment on an unsubsidized loan or when you are repaying a loan under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer need financial assistance as determined by the regulations. In other instances, interest may accrue but not be added to the principal. Keep in mind that a monthly payment will be applied against outstanding interest before it will be applied to your loan principal. In the new SAVE plan, any interest that remains after a monthly payment is applied will be forgiven by ED and your balance will not grow. Call your servicer to understand how the SAVE plan can help you reduce the cost of repaying your federal student loans.

Lower your payment by saving for retirement. Your IDR payment is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), decreases your AGI and your IDR payment too. This could increase the amount forgiven if you are pursuing loan forgiveness through PSLF or IDR.

Getting an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans

Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) is the only income-driven repayment plan available to Parent PLUS borrowers. Getting on ICR is also the best way to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for your Parent PLUS loans. On ICR, your loan balance will also be forgiven after 25 years.

Consolidation is the first step. Parent PLUS loans are not directly eligible for ICR. You must convert them into a Direct Consolidation loan, starting with this free application . The Education Department offers help before and during the consolidation process .

Do not consolidate other federal student loans with Parent PLUS loans. If you do, you will lose other benefits on those other loans, like access to other income-driven plans.

Once you have a consolidation loan, you can request ICR. You can submit your request online  or by calling your servicer.

Set a reminder to renew your enrollment next year. If you fail to recertify your income and household size  , your monthly payment will revert to a payment based on the standard, 10-year payment schedule. Parent Plus borrowers recertify by logging in to your federal student aid account .

Your total loan balance can grow on ICR. If your monthly payment does not cover the accrued interest, your loan balance will go up, even though you’re making payments. Unpaid interest will also capitalize each year until your total balance is 10% higher than the original balance. This means you will pay interest on your interest.

Exercise your rights as a servicemember

Your service counts towards public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). After you make 120 qualifying monthly payments under the PSLF program, you can apply to have your remaining loan balance forgiven, tax free. Learn more about your next steps from the PSLF Help Tool. 

Get your interest rate capped. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) entitles you to have your interest rate reduced to 6% on all debts taken out before your service began, including both federal and private student loans. Federal student loans can be reduced to 0% when you are serving in a hostile area. Reductions in federal student loan interest should happen automatically; check your statements to make sure. Contact your private student loan servicer to request a rate cap.

There are other benefits for active-duty servicemembers with Direct Loans. Check out our guide to student debt for servicemembers  and ED's guide to federal loan benefits for servicemembers. 

Avoid scams and wasting money

Don’t use credit cards or home equity to pay off student loans. Credit cards will cost you way more in interest. If you refinance your loans using home equity and run into trouble paying your mortgage, you could lose your house. Either way, you will lose the flexible repayment options and borrower protections offered by federal student loans.

Don’t go back to school just to avoid loan payments. Even during in-school deferment, your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest. Carefully compare the costs and benefits of more education. Unless it will increase your earnings, more debt could make your financial situation harder in the long run.

Watch out for scams. You may get letters, emails, calls, or text messages advertising loan forgiveness, but you can check those offers against the only federal student loan forgiveness programs.  Never share your loan or bank information, or your studentaid.gov login. Learn the other warning signs of student loan scams.

Don’t pay for help with your student loans. Many companies sell support services, including filling out forms. These services, however, will charge you a fee for something you can do for free.

Free, qualified help is available. Credit counseling nonprofits, which are different from credit repair companies, can help you make a plan to get out of debt. You can look for one near you by searching “credit counseling nonprofit” with the name of your city or town. You can also search for “free student loan advice.”

Take action when you run into problems

First, contact your servicer. Below are some questions to consider asking in different situations. If you’re unsure if the answers you receive are accurate, call back and talk to a different customer service rep, or ask to speak to the servicer’s supervisor.

Thank you for the honor of being chosen as this year’s Distinguished Lecturer on Regulation. I am especially happy to be back at the University of Pennsylvania, even if just virtually. I want to thank Professor Coglianese and the Penn Program on Regulation for organizing today’s event.

Not only did I grow up nearby, I was also fortunate to attend business school here at Penn. Today, my classmates, students, and other alumni are now financiers, convicted felons, and everything in between.

While here – and I was hardly alone on this point – I viewed financial regulators as clueless and often corrupt lawyers and economists. Government officials were often seen as auditioning for a future job in finance to exploit their inside knowledge to help dominant financial firms extract special favors and evade accountability for wrongdoing, even when they violate the law repeatedly.

This brings me to today’s topic: reining in repeat offenders. As always, my remarks today reflect the views of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and do not necessarily represent the views of any other part of the Federal Reserve System.

***

I want to address a vexing problem facing regulators across sectors of the economy: How do we stop large dominant firms from violating the law over and over again with seeming impunity? Corporate recidivism has become normalized and calculated as the cost of doing business; the result is a rinse-repeat cycle that dilutes legal standards and undermines the promise of the financial sector and the entire market system.

Agency and court orders are not suggestions, but many large companies see them as such. While small firms can get hit hard with penalties that threaten their viability and their operators fear imprisonment, many large institutions see the law as mere expenses on their income statements.

The special treatment applied to large financial institutions over their smaller counterparts, as well as the “too big to fail” and “too big to jail” problems, undermines the public’s confidence in the rule of law, a bedrock principle of our society. Honest players and new entrants are disadvantaged, and the whole system is corroded.

Repeat offenders take many forms. The worst type of repeat offender violates a formal court or agency order; this is especially egregious because they often consented to the terms as part of a settlement. They clearly understand the laws and provisions to adhere to but failed to comply due to dysfunction or they took a calculated risk. Another type of repeat offender is one that has multiple violations of law across different business lines, but the violations stem from a common cause. For example, I have found that violations across business lines often relate to problematic sales practice incentives or a failure to properly integrate IT systems after a large merger. In other words, the company may have dealt with some symptoms but didn’t do anything about the disease.

We must forcefully address repeat lawbreakers to alter company behavior and ensure companies realize it is cheaper, and better for their bottom line, to obey the law than to break it.

First, I want to spend my time today talking about some specific examples of big firms that have repeatedly broken the law. Second, I want to explore a case study of the Federal Trade Commission’s handling of Facebook’s repeated violations of law. And finally, I want to describe some of the steps the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators can take to halt recidivism and create a system that treats small and big firms equally.

***

There are many examples of large firms that have repeatedly broken the law but faced few meaningful consequences. This is, of course, true in the financial sector.

For those who do not know, the CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to focus on protecting consumers in the financial marketplace. Even in our relatively short existence, we have seen what other regulators have been seeing for decades: large financial institutions crossing legal fault lines over and over again. Specifically, we have taken action against:

Citigroup – 5 times;
JPMorgan Chase – 4 times;
Wells Fargo – 4 times;
American Express – 3 times; and
Discover – 3 times, one of which was a repeat violation of a previous 2015 CFPB order.

There are many more examples, but you get the point. Repeat offenses – whether it’s for the exact same offense or more malfeasance in different business lines – is par for the course for many dominant firms, including big banks, Big Tech, Big Pharma, and more.

The numbers are also quite large. The CFPB ordered Citibank to pay more than $1 billion in consumer redress. We ordered JPMorgan Chase to pay more than $300 million. All told, in the decade since Congress stripped the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Trade Commission, and other agencies of their authorities and transferred them to the new consumer regulator, the CFPB has already required large corporate recidivists to provide more than $3 billion in consumer redress.

Of course, small players also violate the law. But when they do, they often face punishing sanctions that fundamentally question whether they can remain viable. Dominant firms seem to know that law enforcement will not have that kind of impact on their viability, which allows them to take bigger risks that come with bigger rewards.

After the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, scores of individual bankers were convicted by the Department of Justice. Many were sent to prison. But almost no single senior executive went to jail or was truly held financially accountable for their role in the 2008 financial crisis, even as so many Americans paid a serious price when they lost their homes because they were underwater with toxic mortgages.

Some would argue that these large financial institutions have simply become too big to supervise and that is part of the problem. Government supervisors can’t keep up with the convoluted, behemoth financial products. And government lawyers are never adequately staffed to go up against corporate lawyers trained to spin wheels and run out clocks. Some litigate for years with the hope of the regulator giving up or a new, more forgiving administration coming in. The smaller companies become the low-hanging fruit with cases that are easier to quantify, qualify, and take to court. Whatever the reasons, regulators are willing to lay down the hammer on little guys but settle for press headlines with the big guys.

Often, our laws provide immediate disqualifications from certain privileges for companies found to be engaged in wrongdoing. This is particularly true when it comes to violations of criminal statutes. For example, under federal securities law, an issuer cannot enjoy the privileges of being designated as a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer if they have committed certain felonies, misdemeanors, or violated various anti-fraud laws. This designation gives the largest companies a true competitive advantage over smaller companies in tapping our capital markets. However, the SEC has routinely waived this disqualification. For example, from 2006 to 2015 the SEC granted 23 such waivers to Citigroup, Barclays, UBS, JPMorgan Chase, and Royal Bank of Scotland alone. Meaningful penalties become a paper tiger when regulators are not willing to enforce them, entrenching incentives for large companies to engage in repeated misconduct.

Similarly, violating Department of Justice deferred prosecution agreements, which are deals made between the DOJ and companies to postpone prosecution on the conditions of better behaviors, have become quite common with corporate defendants. For example, JPMorgan Chase has a long history of multiple, overlapping deals with the DOJ. In 2020, the DOJ offered JPMorgan a deferred prosecution agreement for its eight years of “separate schemes” relating to trading, despite the fact that, as the DOJ acknowledged in the same press release, the company had already pled guilty to “similar misconduct involving manipulative and deceptive trading practices.”

There has been a lot of noise by government officials that big financial institutions are not “too big to jail,” but the way government has been treating them suggests otherwise. This simply raises the stakes in what we do, as government regulators, when wrongdoers are caught.

***

I now want to discuss one of the best examples of failed repeat offender enforcement: the Federal Trade Commission’s treatment of one of the largest and most well-known corporations in the world: Facebook. Facebook is a clear example of a politically powerful firm that routinely violated the terms of its government order with no real consequences.

I raise Facebook not only because it is such an egregious case but also because of the potential of very large firms entering financial services. It’s clear that Big Tech wants to get into the market, as we saw with Facebook’s failed attempt to create a new global currency. We’ve also seen Alibaba, Amazon, Google, and Tencent entering financial services, including with payments, money management, insurance, and lending. Given their size and customer reach, their entry has the potential to transform the industry. How these companies engage in other business practices is how we can expect them to engage in financial services, so it is worth going into some detail about the FTC case against one of the biggest players in this space.

In 2011, the FTC voted to issue an eight-count complaint against Facebook. According to the FTC, Facebook “deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.” The FTC simultaneously settled the matter for no money but required that Facebook cease its deceptive conduct and implement a program to ensure that privacy promises were kept. The settlement also gave the Commission broad access to company documents and personnel to ensure the company would not break the law again.

I arrived at the FTC as a Commissioner in May of 2018. The agency was in deep decay and disarray after years of lax enforcement against large corporate actors, spanning multiple administrations. In some of the most widespread recent nationwide crises, from the 2008 financial disaster to the opioid epidemic to the student loan and for-profit college scandals, the FTC was essentially missing. On a bipartisan basis, the Commission heavily relied on a “no-money, no-fault” settlement strategy, where wrongdoers essentially faced no consequences, even in cases of egregious fraud.

In the case of Facebook, though, the company was already subject to an FTC order, and violations of an order were subject to significant consequences under existing law. But for many observers, the FTC simply seemed to be watching from the sidelines as its orders were being openly flouted.

A few months prior to my arrival at the Commission, it came to light that Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, to harvest information from more than 50 million individuals and use it for political purposes. This was just one of many controversies where Facebook broke its promises to employ reasonable safeguards to keep personal information private unless the user gave explicit affirmative consent.

As a matter of credibility for the U.S. government, I thought it was essential for the FTC to enforce its own order. For years and years, though, Commissioners set up agency staff to fail. Commissioners deployed armies to small-scale scams, while depriving staff of the needed resources to police Facebook and other Big Tech firms. It was clear that these firms did not think the FTC was serious at all.

By the summer of 2019, we prepared a six-count, 50-page complaint that detailed a long list of privacy failures, including substantial order violations. That was clearly just scratching the surface of the company’s problems. But rather than investigating the matter fully or demanding significant changes to Facebook’s data harvesting practices, Commissioners pursued what many believed to be a publicity stunt.

I admit that the negotiated settlement accepted by a majority of the Commission made for a great headline. But the fine print in the settlement gave a lot for Facebook to celebrate. Facebook would pay a $5 billion fine but did not have to make any material changes to its business practices. Shockingly, Facebook was able to secure a highly unusual immunity clause for its executives, including for Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. Zuckerberg was also able to retain absolute control over the corporation; though the settlement required a so-called independent committee on privacy whose members would need to be approved by a shareholder vote; and we know Zuckerberg essentially controls a supermajority of voting rights.

Three of the commissioners held a press conference, complete with custom-made graphics, about the “record-setting” nature of the settlement. In fairness, $5 billion does sound very significant. But Facebook had become one of the most valuable corporations in the world, approaching a trillion-dollar valuation. During the press conference, a senior career official largely admitted that Commissioners agreed to forego seeking testimony and documents from Zuckerberg in exchange for a higher fine. It was clear to many that the company paid off the FTC to minimize scrutiny of its top executives’ role in the order violations.

News of the settlement quickly set off alarm bells among data protection regulators around the world. A global consensus emerged that the settlement was a sham.

In my voting statement opposing the settlement, I described how Facebook flagrantly violated the FTC’s 2012 order and how the proposed settlement did little to change the business model or practices that led to the recidivism. The settlement imposed no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to the violations. Nor did it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics. Instead, the order allowed Facebook to decide for itself how much information it could harvest from users and what it could do with that information, as long as it created a paper trail.

The proposed settlement let Facebook off the hook for unspecified violations and it gave Facebook a legal shield of unusual breadth, deviating from standard FTC practice. Indeed, when the settlement was announced against Facebook, its stock popped.

In my view, there were many lessons from the FTC’s Facebook saga:

For very large firms, seemingly large fines, even ones that are “record-setting,” may appear to be very punitive, but may have little effect;
Corporate boards will go to great lengths to shield top executives from scrutiny, even though they are all bound by agency orders; and
Committees, paperwork, compliance units, and other procedural requirements have much higher monitoring costs than bright-line structural remedies that meaningfully change business incentives.

We need to learn from these lessons to think about not only how to halt recidivism, but also how to treat small and big firms equally when it comes to enforcement actions.

***

Finally, I’ll close with how regulators should be sharpening their focus on repeat offenders and discuss some of the non-monetary, structural remedies agencies might seek in order to levy the same kind of deterrents on small and big firms alike.

Achieving general deterrence is an important goal for the CFPB. We need penalties where the expected financial benefits of an illegal scheme do not outweigh the expected costs. And we need an understanding that agency and court orders are not suggestions. Put plainly, regulators charged with overseeing large institutions have lost credibility when it comes to halting repeat offenders. While headline-driven penalties give the guise of deterrence, they do not work for dominant, powerful firms.

In the end, we need to look at bright-line structural remedies, rather than press-driven approaches. As any gardener knows, to address a weed, you need to get at the root, rather than constantly monitoring what is simply seen on the surface.

Indeed, when the CFPB helped to uncover the “fake accounts” scandal at Wells Fargo, it was not necessarily the $100 million fine on the bank that was material. Instead, it was the Federal Reserve Board’s decision to impose a growth cap that got the institution’s attention. And when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency took a role in vetting appointments of new executive hires, that also got their attention. Rather than relying solely on penalties and procedural paperwork, it is critical that regulators and enforcers shift their mindset in this way when it comes to remedies.

At the CFPB, we have plans to establish dedicated units in our supervision and enforcement divisions to enhance the detection of repeat offenses and corporate recidivists and to better hold them accountable. This will include closer scrutiny to ensure orders are being followed and closer coordination with partner agencies to ensure that each agency’s orders are not treated as suggestions. It is critical that we – regulators, enforcers, and supervisors – support each other in effectuating deterrence and compliance with orders.

But more importantly, for serial offenders of federal law, the CFPB will be looking at remedies that are more structural in nature, with lower enforcement and monitoring costs. Under our authorizing statute, the CFPB may seek “limits on the activities or functions” of a firm for violations of laws, regulations, and orders.

These are reforms that are needed throughout government. Depending on the specific facts, government enforcement agencies have an arsenal of options to truly stop the repeated illegal practices at big financial institutions. Let me run through some of the most important options. While many government regulators have sought such limitations on small businesses, they have shown less willingness to do so with larger and more powerful firms. This needs to change.

First: Caps on size or growth. When you impose asset caps, limitations on transferring or acquiring assets, or related limitations that impact the entity overall, you are curbing incentives to break the law and boosting incentives for compliance.

Second: Bans on certain types of business practices. When you put limits on business or product lines, or you close business lines or specific practices, it stops the immediate harm and stops the company from violating the law again in the future. For example, after LendUp violated a 2016 CFPB order to stop misleading customers about the benefits of its loans, we took action. We stopped LendUp from making new loans, collecting on outstanding loans to harmed customers, and selling customer information. LendUp, a former darling of venture capital, is now shutting down.

Third: Divestitures of certain product lines. Sometimes it is not a toxic product but the business model around that product or the management of the product that is the problem, in which case it makes sense to spin it off so it can operate legally. When order violations stem from a firm’s lack of managerial acumen, this is especially relevant to ensure that all subsidiaries and affiliates are obeying the law.

Fourth: Limitations on leverage or requirements to raise equity capital. When you put guardrails on how the company is fundamentally funded, it mitigates chances that a company will become over-leveraged and engage in the type of dangerous “gambling for resurrection” behavior that can harm customers and our economy. Putting these limitations on the table also serves as a powerful deterrent given financial companies’ desire to maximize their risky debt-funding and short-term return-on-equity.

Fifth: Revocation of government-granted privileges. Large firms are often required to meet certain conditions to maintain privileges authorized by the public through administrative agencies. For example, pharmaceutical companies rely on patents and sell products to government payors. Misconduct can lead to losing these benefits. Meat and poultry firms must often register with government authorities and can lose their registration if engaged in certain wrongdoing.

For repeat offenders that are insured depository institutions, they can lose access to federal deposit insurance or their ability to continue operating. For example, regulators should assess whether it is appropriate to terminate or limit access to FDIC deposit insurance or to put banks directly into receivership. Congress specified that institutions that are unsafe and unsound may be subject to losing access to FDIC deposit insurance or their ability to stay in business. Repeat offenses and, in particular, order violations, may be a sign that an institution’s condition or behavior is unsafe and unsound.

For licensed nonbank institutions, the CFPB will be deepening its collaboration with state licensing officials, so that states can ascertain whether licenses should be suspended or whether corporate assets should be liquidated. If senior management is unable to remedy deep-seated failures, it may be appropriate to liquidate, disband, or otherwise shut down the institution to prevent further harms or legal violations. Indeed, since our nation’s founding, regulators in the U.S. have a history of terminating corporate charters and licenses. Today, this should be considered for institutions of all sizes when the facts and circumstances warrant it.

Finally, the role of individual liability cannot be discounted. When small businesses get in trouble, regulators and enforcers are quick to target the top brass. It is inappropriate and unfair to not have the same approach to big financial institutions when the facts and circumstances of the role of individuals is the same.

Agency and court orders bind officers and directors of the corporation, and so do the laws themselves, so there are multiple ways in which individuals are held accountable. Where individuals play a role in repeat offenses and order violations, it may be appropriate for regulatory agencies and law enforcers to charge these individuals and disqualify them. Dismissal of senior management and board directors, and lifetime occupational bans should also be more frequently deployed in enforcement actions involving large firms.

When it comes to individuals, we also need to pay close attention to executive compensation incentives. Important remedies for restoring law and order may include clawbacks, forfeitures, and other changes to executive compensation, including where we tie up compensation for longer periods of time and use that deferred compensation as the first pot of money to pay fines.

Such actions are more likely to halt recidivism than fines paid from the profits of wrongdoing.

***

In the end, large dominant firms should be subject to the same consequences of enforcement actions as small firms. We need to end double-standard enforcement that exists. We need to move away from just monetary penalties and consider an arsenal of options that really work to stop repeat offenses.

More importantly, when the public perceives that powerful actors in the economy and society live by a different set of rules, this deeply undermines the promise of the rule of law and our market system. We can and must change course on this. Thank you.

Prepared Remarks by Richard Cordray
Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

Project Catalyst: Stimulating Innovation in Financial Products and Services

Mountain View, California
November 14, 2012

Thank you. We are so happy to be here in California today. We are also glad to see so many people coming together in the same place to talk about innovation. You bring a great variety of experiences – in entrepreneurship, investing, nonprofits, and government – to inform and enliven this conversation. It is a conversation of special importance to the leadership at the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we have been looking forward to this day and building up to this moment for many months now.

For the past sixteen months, we have enjoyed the extraordinary benefit of being a start-up ourselves, as a new government agency with an attractive and important mission. Our mission is to help make the consumer financial marketplace work better for consumers, for responsible businesses, and for the economy as a whole. And so our mission is relevant to every American who is a consumer of financial products and services – which is to say, all of us.

The challenges embodied in this mission are immense, but so are the opportunities. Like every human being who undertakes to try something new, with all the risk and uncertainty that entails, we feel very much alive in our work every day. Ernest Hemingway said that bullfighters are the only people who live their lives “all the way up.” It may sound odd to presume to say the same thing about government regulators, but we feel we are doing just that. And it is a marvelous feeling.

Those of us here today share a common vision of a strong and vibrant consumer finance marketplace, one that is rooted in the daily lives of individual Americans. The kind of market that not only attends and responds to people’s needs, but anticipates what those needs will be and conceptualizes how to fulfill them more effectively.

At its bedrock, a vibrant marketplace not only mirrors how people actually live their lives, but envisions how they might want to live even better – perhaps with more certainty, or more convenience, or more impact. An innovative marketplace is one in which consumers are constantly thinking to themselves, “Boy, I never thought of that – but someone else did, and what they have created is just great for me!”

In our own lives, we can see how a properly functioning consumer finance market helps us achieve our deepest aspirations – such as buying a home, paying for college, or saving for retirement. Many would not be able to pursue these opportunities without access to credit. Thomas Gray wrote in his famous elegy about how “chill penury” constrains the boundaries of so many people’s lives – people with talents undiscovered or potential unfulfilled.

In a poignant passage, he illustrates the massive waste of human talent that unfolds across the globe in every generation by lamenting that “Full many a gem of purest ray serene/The dark unfathom’d caves of ocean bear:/Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,/And waste its sweetness on the desert air.” More effective markets for consumer finance cannot alone make people rich – nobody claims to be Rumpelstiltskin – but they can improve the ways and means of people’s financial lives. And if we can do that, then people will find their way forward to fulfill their own personal version of the American dream.

The recent financial crisis, however, posed a formidable threat to this vision. In the run-up to the crisis of 2007-2008, innovation in consumer finance too often meant the creation and promotion of products that obscured costs and risks from consumers.

Irresponsible lending that was often predatory in nature; patchwork regulation that was often ineffectual in practice; complexity and confusion that too often marred what financial products were achieving in people’s individual lives and across the economy as a whole – all of these problems led to a calamity in which trillions of dollars in household wealth vaporized across this country, and economic opportunity, including access to credit, receded dramatically for millions of Americans.

In the wake of the crisis, and as part of broader financial reform, Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Our mission, as I have said, is to make consumer financial markets actually work for consumers and for responsible providers of financial products and services.

And we have a number of effective tools to execute on this mission, including rule-writing authority for consumer finance markets; examination authority over key financial institutions to monitor and ensure compliance with consumer laws; enforcement authority to root out violations and make redress to harmed consumers; consumer response authority to address individual complaints; and a mandate to engage with consumers to educate and empower them in the marketplace.

But we also see the need to undertake a further attitudinal shift in how government understands its role. One of the more interesting things that Congress did when it created the Bureau was to single out as one of our explicit objectives the responsibility to foster innovation in consumer financial products and services. One might legitimately ask, “What does government have to do with that? Is not innovation the business of the private sector operating in the free market?” We have thought hard about these questions, and we have talked to many entrepreneurs about them.

And what we have found is that regulators often can impede innovation, by not recognizing its importance for consumers and by freezing people who want to try new things but cannot get any straight answers about how to deal with the risks of regulatory uncertainty or novel issues of how existing laws will be applied to unforeseen products and approaches.

We are serious about rethinking our optimal role because we clearly understand that innovators – whether housed in mainstream institutions or in start-ups – are often the first to note new consumer needs and are faster to find new creative solutions that make consumers better off.

We believe that good, consumer-friendly innovation holds great potential for achieving our mission of making the consumer finance market work again for consumers. We want to help as much as we can to stimulate innovation in financial products and services.

***

In that spirit, we are launching today what we call Project Catalyst, our initial overture to encourage innovation in consumer finance. Through this project, the CFPB will be engaging more closely with companies and entrepreneurs who are at the front lines of innovation. To start with, we have identified two goals for Project Catalyst: outreach and collaboration.

First, we want to make affirmative efforts to open lines of communication with innovators. We need to better understand what we can do to promote consumer-friendly innovation. The economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote approvingly about the “wild spirits” of capitalism – those entrepreneurs with the boldness, the courage, and the daring to discover and pursue a different paradigm, whose efforts unleash the forces of “creative destruction” that generate technological and economic progress. Innovators can succeed by helping consumers – and we want to help facilitate that process by better understanding what is in the way and how we might be able to work to clear the path.

We have already conducted early outreach to the innovator community. We have met with entrepreneurs, academics, investors, nonprofits, and industry executives. And today, to complement this event, we are launching a portion of our web page dedicated to communication between the Bureau and innovators.

Through this outreach we have already received some useful suggestions. For example, we have been told that because consumer financial regulations often are written in light of specific existing products, they can intersect very inefficiently with new permutations. We are seeing this right now, for example, with prepaid cards where we will be proposing new regulations because they are not explicitly covered by existing consumer protections. So we are interested to hear more about where this is the case and about potential solutions that can both protect consumers and promote innovation.

For this project to succeed, open lines of communication between ourselves and the innovator community are critical. That starts with folks knowing more about our agency, understanding our mission, and seeing that we are willing to be accessible to them. Today’s event embodies our commitment to working in this manner with all of you.

***

The second goal of Project Catalyst is to engage in collaborations with innovators. We want entrepreneurs to be able to come to us with new ideas where they feel that collaboration would help them press forward with a consumer-friendly financial innovation. These collaborations will be designed to help us and the other parties understand what works and does not work for consumers. Two approaches in particular are promising: data sharing and disclosure testing.

Innovators know there is nothing like watching how the market responds to your ideas with real data to guide your next steps. We feel the same way at the Bureau, and among our foundational principles is that we are a data-driven agency. We recognize the power of live data to improve our understanding of the marketplace and to inform how we make decisions.

Already we have been building a consumer complaint database and sharing information with the public, and we are now underway to build an ambitious national mortgage database that will allow both our agency and others to gain a much more complete understanding of this largest single consumer finance market worth trillions of dollars. We know that many of the soundest innovators take a similar data-driven approach to their work, and that we can learn from each other in making decisions.

Through Project Catalyst, we will be inviting businesses that have new ideas to share their data with us about how these new ideas function in the marketplace. We want to learn more about what innovators are learning about consumer desires and practices – so that we can bring as much real-world data to the full range of our activities as possible. And, as noted already, we are committed to developing new realms of information about consumer financial markets and to helping people gain new insight from their ability to analyze that information. In some cases, our ability to standardize the disclosure of information will help foster product comparisons and empower consumers to gain more leverage in the marketplace, where knowledge is power.

Today we are excited to announce three particular data-sharing collaborations. The data sharing will not contain personally identifiable information and appropriate precautions will be taken to ensure that individual consumers cannot be identified through the data. Our first is with BillGuard, a company that alerts consumers to questionable charges on their debit and credit cards and helps them resolve billing disputes quickly. BillGuard will share their billing dispute data with us, which will allow us to observe trends in consumer complaints and complaint resolution.

Our second collaboration is with Simple. Simple is designed to be an alternative to traditional banking. This collaboration will explore how consumers can gain insight into their spending habits and help the Bureau understand what tools can encourage saving.

Finally, we are teaming up with Plastyc, which is also designed to be an alternative to traditional banking. Plastyc will be sharing data to help us understand how analytics-driven answers can decrease consumer confusion and call volume. Our collaboration will also focus on the value that consumers place on being able more easily to deposit and gain immediate access to their funds.

These collaborations work in different ways, but they share a common approach. In each of them, an innovative idea will generate interesting data about consumer behavior. And by collaborating with these companies, the Bureau can better understand what works for consumers in the marketplace and inform our policy-making in the process.

***

A second approach to collaboration is through disclosure testing. At the Bureau, we see huge opportunities for innovation when it comes to empowering consumers to make better-informed decisions. We know that consumers need to understand the costs and risks of a financial product before deciding whether to use it.

In the traditional world of consumer protection, disclosures are provided when the consumer shops for or purchases a product, or through periodic disclosures like monthly statements. When these disclosures are effective, they benefit the public and the markets by driving competition based on informed customer choice. And they deprive businesses of any unfair advantage gained from confusing customers with opaque back-end pricing. However, in today’s world of ever-changing technology and products, traditional disclosures may not always be enough.

We have launched initiatives to make such disclosures more useful for consumers. Our signature initiative is our “Know Before You Owe” mortgage project. In seeking to develop more useful mortgage disclosures, we have sought repeated input from the public. We worked through tens of thousands of comments from consumers to figure out which disclosures are the most helpful to them and which are not.

But we have much to learn in this area. For example, we know that more information does not always means more understanding. One of the interesting conundrums in the consumer world, indeed, is that often providing more information to consumers leads to the opposite result by making it difficult for them to identify or grasp the key points or even discouraging them from trying to understand at all. New technologies, developed by entrepreneurs to process or personalize the most critical information, can empower people and create the potential for great advances in consumer satisfaction.

Through Project Catalyst, we hope to identify and work with innovators who are experimenting with new approaches to informing consumers and to learn from their experiences. In fact, Congress gave us the authority to engage in trial disclosure programs in exactly these kinds of circumstances. And in the coming months, we hope to explore opportunities for collaborating on such trial disclosures.

***

We believe that innovation holds great potential for achieving our mission of making consumer finance markets work better for consumers and for responsible providers. With the launch of our Project Catalyst, we are committed to ongoing outreach and collaborations with innovators that are working in consumer finance.

One of the most important points we want to establish today is about our mindset. The Consumer Bureau itself is a start-up, and we want to establish attitudes and processes that embody our aspiration to be an innovative and forward-looking agency. We are eager to listen and learn from your diverse set of perspectives and to brainstorm together about how we can do things differently to make consumer finance work better for consumers. And we appreciate your willingness to take your time to do that with us.

Thank you, and we look forward to more of these conversations.

I’m pleased to kick off this public meeting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Advisory Board. Our advisory board is composed of individuals from across the Federal Reserve System’s districts, many of whom serving at the recommendation of the Reserve Bank Presidents. I want to thank each of our members for their service.

Today’s meeting will focus on tech: both in the present and in the future. Our agenda will include a discussion on the fast-growing Buy Now, Pay Later market, where many industry players harvest extraordinary amounts of data to sculpt a personalized retail user experience to induce more shopping and borrowing. We will review the CFPB’s latest study and some of the implications of our analysis, including some of the agency’s next steps.

We will also spend time on peer-to-peer payment systems. Last year, the CFPB ordered a number of Big Tech giants and dominant peer-to-peer payment platforms to provide information and data about what they collect, how they decide to kick off users, and what they do to observe existing consumer protections, like those related to fraud. Greater adoption of these services is leading to significant shifts and challenges for the consumer finance ecosystem.

But, first, we will discuss the CFPB’s launch of the Personal Financial Data Rights rulemaking, which seeks to accelerate America’s shift toward open banking and a more decentralized market structure. We are implementing these rules using a dormant authority under Section 1033 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

Last week, at an industry conference, I presented some of our goals for the rulemaking and for the future of open banking: promoting openness, increasing switching, reducing reliance on credit scores, protecting sensitive personal data, and preventing domination and monopolization. I also had a chance to meet with the FDIC’s Advisory Committee on economic inclusion and raised questions about the impact of open banking on the unbanked and underbanked, especially with respect to data and privacy.

I am encouraged by the positive reactions from across the consumer finance ecosystem on our planned approach. Of course, there is a lot of work that must be done.

Before I turn it over to the staff to guide the discussion, I want to surface an area where we have been devoting quite a bit of thinking and are eager for your input throughout the rulemaking process. It relates to industry standard-setting organizations and providers of critical infrastructure.

In the U.S., private organizations play a major role in setting standards across sectors of the economy. Telecommunications and health care provide some of the best examples, but financial services are no different. Sometimes these organizations are not neutral, but are instead owned or governed by certain market participants. Others may also integrate a function akin to a lobbying or trade association.

Decentralized, open banking will likely rely on fair standard-setting, through an amalgam of legally binding rules and industry developed standards. It can be difficult to achieve fair standard-setting, since incumbents will have a strong economic interest when it comes to protecting their turf.

In the United Kingdom, an Open Banking Implementation Entity was established to provide critical services and infrastructure, among other duties. Here, at home, there are already many efforts to ensure a common set of standards to exchange data. The CFPB is gleaning insights on the experience abroad, as well as domestic developments.

The CFPB will be developing the implementing rules with a practical mindset of how rules would be operationalized in the market.

We’re excited to continue our work collecting feedback on how we can create an open and competitive banking environment in our country. Thank you.

best practices for budgeting personal finances,marketwatch,The 10 best cars for college students,No disponible,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-best-cars-for-college-students-bbf29a6b?mod=search_headline,"Opinions about the best cars for college students are like belly buttons: everyone has one. The problem with creating a collection of such picks is weighing the qualifiers. That is, measuring requirements like safety options against fuel economy and price against utility. Several considerations should influence a buying decision when shopping for cars for college students, but sometimes, they conflict. In other words, there are tradeoffs.

We help you tiptoe through this minefield.

Things to consider when buying a car for college

There are many variables to weigh when picking any car, let alone one for a college student. The process can be overwhelming. We started with a price ceiling of $30,000. That may seem high, but we wanted to include some new models. You can find several picks among our used cars that cost much less than that ceiling.

Other factors include car ownership costs, safety, technology, and practicality.

Do you need a car in college?

When considering a car for the college-bound, need versus want is the first hurdle. Does this particular college experience require a vehicle? If it doesn’t, a car will simply be another fuel, insurance, and maybe parking expense. It will also be a distraction.

Some colleges don’t allow first-year college students to have cars. Many colleges limit parking on campus through permits. A car at college can be a real hassle. If a personal vehicle isn’t necessary for getting to a job or to and from an off-campus residence, it may be more of a want than a need. If so, consider skipping it, at least for the first few years.

What is unique about buying a car for college?

Chances are a young adult heading to college will still rely on family to some degree, at least for financial support. Though not always the case, more often than not, it is. So, car buying will be somewhat of a balancing act between what your student wants and what the family, maybe already stretched thin by college expenses, can afford. Everyone involved should be ready for some compromise.

When picking a car, remember that it may also need to continue as the primary mode of transportation after college and into the first few years of building a career. Put a little time into thinking about what that may look like regarding the cost of ownership, commuting needs, and lifestyle.

Can I afford a car in college?

An affordable payment is a function of a vehicle’s cost. Those payments must be kept low, whether the parents or the student shoulder the monthly installments. Most carmakers use a captive financing company, such as Ford 

F

1.03%
 Credit or Honda Financial Services, that offers financing deals on new and certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles. This is an excellent place to start.

If you are securing a loan outside of captive financing, all things being equal, you will almost always score a lower monthly payment on a used vehicle than a new one. Credit unions are known to offer lower percentage rates on car loans. With interest rates going up these days, it’s something to consider.

Check out the Kelley Blue Book 5-Year Cost to Own page to compare the lowest cost-to-own car models. It considers the costs to maintain the vehicle and depreciation.

How much will car insurance cost a college student?

Insurance cost is a key contributor to the total cost of ownership. It’s no secret that some vehicles cost less to insure than others. Auto insurance is highly competitive, and shopping around can save you money.

However, premiums are influenced by several personal factors, such as driving record, annual mileage, place of residence, and so forth. Historically, drivers younger than 25 can expect insurance to be a significant factor in the total cost of ownership. Involve your insurance costs in your purchase decision.

Does a car’s fuel economy matter at college?

Gasoline is one of those monthly expenses that can vary wildly from year to year. It all has to do with fluctuations in the price of oil. Seek vehicles delivering better fuel economy, especially if operating on a tight budget.

Even if you can afford to keep a truck or large car fueled at current gas prices, what if the per-gallon price increases by $1 over the next year?

Other than the occasional trip home for a weekend, college students tend to do most of their driving in an urban setting. Although a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) might not be practical for dorm or apartment living, a traditional hybrid (HEV) will save a few trips to the pump. HEVs tend to cost a bit more than conventional cars. A used HEV may be a better choice.

What role does safety play in a car for college?

Safety features and ratings should always be key qualifiers for anyone purchasing a vehicle, regardless of age or purpose. As you narrow your choices, check out the crash test scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Our picks scored high with most of them. You can see what crash tests entail in our story on the best cars for teens.

There are certain safety features you don’t want to do without. If you stick with 2013 and newer models, that’s the first year antilock brakes, traction control, and stability control were all mandated by the United States government. If a backup camera is essential to you, the federal government mandated that feature in 2018. However, many cars already had them by then.

The newer the model, the more likely you will find other essential safety and driver-assist features like automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, and blind-spot monitoring. If you need more information about which trim levels include the safety features you want, go to Kelley Blue Book’s Expert Reviews for new and used vehicles. You can check out the latest safety features in our Safety Features 101 article.

What other factors impact a college car?

Features like four doors, creative storage solutions with places to hide laptops, easy parking manners, and so forth are important, particularly if the vehicle will jump from college to first-job transportation.

Technology features are critical on several levels. For example, voice recognition allows vocalizing commands to change the music or temperature level without taking your eyes off the road. But staying connected is of the utmost concern for most college-age people.

At the very least, they expect to be able to charge and integrate their devices into a vehicle’s infotainment system. Again, the newer the model, the more connectivity options, like USB-C charging ports, will be current and available.

Car shopping in today’s market

Several factors continue to conspire to reduce select new and used vehicle inventories. The industry’s primary culprit is lingering issues from the past microchip shortage and a general shortage of used vehicles from the 2008 recession. However, inventories of new and used cars have greatly improved over the last year. We saw a downward movement in the average prices for new vehicles that now have leveled off. Still, you’ll see stubbornly high car prices at some brands and limited choices at others. But, there is hope now that inventories are near normal for many new vehicles. For used cars, expect those costing less than $20,000 to remain the most difficult to find.

See: The most reliable car brands to buy used, according to a Consumer Reports ranking

Your vehicle-buying dollars may not stretch as far, and you will likely need to make a few compromises on car color and content to secure the type of car you want. If you shop for a new car, you may find a better deal among your dealer’s certified pre-owned cars or on the used car lot. In other words, stay flexible.

The Hyundai Elantra experienced a freshening for 2024. Easy to recommend, it’s a comfy, reliable family hauler. For the modest price of the entry-level SE, you get an EPA-rated 36 mpg combined mileage and Hyundai’s SmartSense suite of safety driver-assist goodies. Forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, lane centering, driver-attention warning, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert are included.

Other standard features include high-beam assist, an 8-inch touchscreen, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth connectivity with voice recognition, and two USB ports. These are some reasons why it’s a past KBB Compact Car Best Buy.

The 2024 Elantra earned a 5-Star rating from NHTSA. Furthermore, the IIHS named it a 2024 Top Safety Pick.

Highlighted by its large interior, the Honda HR-V delivers a respectable 28 mpg in combined city-highway driving. The HR-V is a 2024 IIHS Top Safety Pick+. We like the HR-V not only for its relatively roomy cabin but also for its available all-wheel drive (AWD) and a plethora of safety tech.

The price here is for the entry-level LX trim, which comes standard with the Honda Sensing suite of driver aids like forward collision warning, auto emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control. However, you have to move up to the Sport to get the Blind Spot Information System with a cross-traffic monitor.

Our listed price is for the 2.5 S 5-door model. The sedan is about $1,000 less. Mazda earned a 2024 Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS for the Mazda3. It’s also good for an EPA-estimated 31 mpg in combined city-highway driving. Boasting excellent handling, the Mazda3 can be fitted with all-wheel drive. The optional I-Activ system is also why we named this car one of our Best Cars for Snow.

Inside, the Mazda3 feels more expensive than it is. Although you must move up to the Select grade for blind-spot monitoring, the entry-level Mazda3 comes with forward collision warning, emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, driver attention alert, and high-beam assist. Bluetooth connectivity with voice recognition, an 8.8-inch touchscreen, and two USB ports come standard. Of the two body styles, we like the Mazda3 hatchback because it provides up to 47 cubic feet of cargo space.

Totally redesigned for 2024, the Hyundai Kona is a subcompact SUV that offers tremendous value. Its small size means it’s easy to park on campus, and the rear cargo area is well suited to carry gear. In addition, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity come standard. Fuel economy is as good as 31 mpg on the highway with the gas engine. A Kona electric vehicle (EV) is also available. We like the Kona for its bar-setting warranty, class-leading space, and outstanding overall value.

The Kona has been on the market for a few years and has proven reliable. In addition, it’s tapped by the IIHS as a Top Safety Pick+ and scored an NHTSA 5-Star rating. There is plenty of value here, as even the base SE model comes standard with blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, forward collision-avoidance assist, lane-change assist, and rear cross-traffic collision warning.

We were in the U.S. to work for the summer on J-1 exchange visitor visas, and the organizers of the program explained some peculiarities about American life. We were given three warnings. 

1. THINK TWICE before jaywalking. It’s illegal. 

2. DO NOT confuse U.S. mailboxes with Irish trash cans. 

3. NEVER, EVER walk out of a restaurant without tipping. The waiter or waitress will chase you down the street looking for their tip. They rely on their tips. They won’t react kindly to you stiffing them. It’s not like Europe, where people tip 10% or nothing at all. Here you should tip 15% to 20%. Just double the sales tax, and you’ll be all right. 

It put the fear of God into us. Forget about getting a ticket or a $250 fine for jaywalking, or upsetting the mailman, who might have to peel a sticky popsicle wrapper from the mail. It was the vision of an enraged server accosting us on the street for forgetting to leave a tip that made a lasting impression. It made “Taxi Driver” seem like “Bambi.”

The U.S. presidential election campaign has lately seen separate pledges by Republican nominee Donald Trump (two months ago) and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris (last weekend) to end taxes on tips. Republicans have introduced the No Tax on Tips Act, which counts Nevada’s two Democratic U.S. senators as co-sponsors.

“Everyone’s looking for an edge in swing states, so, even though this may only make up a portion of the workforce, if it’s an important portion of swing voters in swing states, policies that appeal to them are getting more attention,” said Jonah Berger, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who worked as a waiter in his youth. From that personal experience, he adds, “Taxes can have a big impact on people’s livelihood.”

The warning to always tip is ironic, in an Alanis Morissette sort of way, given that tipping reportedly started in Europe in the Middle Ages, when guests at the homes of wealthy landowners would tip the servants. “The practice did not become widespread until the late 19th Century,” according to the 2009 book “Tipping: An American Social History of Gratuities” by Kerry Segrave.

“Initially, Americans reviled the custom, branding it un-American and undemocratic. The opposition gradually faded and tipping became an American institution,” Segrave wrote, describing tipping “a quintessentially American trait” and the U.S. as “a nation of tippers.”

But today, many people balk at the digital tipping options they encounter in ice-cream parlors, taxicabs and coffee shops. The lingering resentment over the surge in tipping prompts has gotten rolled into consumer concerns about inflation, labor unions, property prices, rent and exploitation of workers by employers who pay tipped workers less than minimum wage.

Economic exploitation of tipped workers

Taxing tips is a double whammy for underpaid workers. In fact, Nina Mast, an economic analyst with the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, sees tips as a modern tool of racist oppression in the South. “Tipped workers are more likely to be people of color, women, women of color, or single parents, and are disproportionately born outside of the U.S.,” she wrote in a paper published last June. 

Tipped workers experience high rates of poverty and are vulnerable to wage theft and sexual harassment, she said. “The South has the largest tipped workforce of any region. Tipped workers in the South are paid the second lowest median wage of any region, and most Southern states allow employers to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 an hour,” Mast wrote.

In that context, taxing tips seems punitive.

The subminimum wage, which some tipped workers receive in more than half a dozen U.S. states, is a uniquely American institution that is “rooted in the exploitation of formerly enslaved Black workers following emancipation,” Mast said. “Wealthy Americans vacationing in Europe got a taste of the aristocratic — including the continent’s medieval tradition of giving servants extra money for particularly good service,” she added.

Tipped workers tend to have lower incomes — the median weekly wage for tipped occupations in 2023 was $538, versus $1,000 for nontipped workers, according to the Budget Lab, a research center at Yale University. More than a third — 37% — of tipped workers paid no federal income tax in 2022 due to their low wages, compared with 16% of nontipped workers.

Today, most Americans see tipping as a courtesy, and many customers would understandably prefer that 100% of their tips go to the server rather than the owner of the coffee house or restaurant or spa. But the custom still prompts questions: Do I look cheap by tipping 15%? Am I the big man on campus by leaving a whopping tip in front of my friends after consuming a gin and tonic and half a bottle of wine? 

Tipped workers may comprise only 2.5% of the workforce, but all of us are tippers.

As one reader told me last year: “Not tipping 20% makes you look like a fascist. I tipped 15% once on a date, and the guy made some smart comment — ‘Oh, you’re only tipping 15%?’ — and I never saw him again.”

Therein lies at least another part of the puzzle. Tipped workers may comprise only 2.5% of the workforce, but all of us are tippers.

“Tipped-income earners may be a relatively small part of the workforce, but from a political perspective, they represent a very important group. Most tipped workers are also younger voters,” said Forrest Morgeson, an associate professor of marketing at Michigan State University. “Both the Trump and Harris campaigns are keen to woo these voters, of course.”

Morgeson added: “Indeed, much of Harris’s momentum in the polls since President Joe Biden withdrew from the race could be attributed to shifting preferences among younger voters. Addressing something like taxes on tips could thus be seen as a move — by both campaigns — to solidify or even grow a lead among this critical demographic.”

But people — voters — don’t like to be told what to do. There is a delicate balance between expectation and result. “Increasingly, however, tipping is viewed as mandatory, even in contexts where we normally did not tip at all just a few years ago. The standards for what percentage of the total bill reflects a ‘normal’ tip are changing,” Morgeson said. 

Consumers who have tipping fatigue may blame workers. As this letter writer said: “I’m a tradesman, and we pay for our tools, vehicles and years of training while earning zip. I refuse tips when offered, as I have a job. Low-paying jobs are the economy’s way of saying you should get a better job. The more places that ask, the less I feel like tipping. It does not stop spreading.”

Service workers are American heroes

Older people may be the first to balk, Morgeson said. “For older consumers especially, the idea of tipping 30% on a cup of coffee from an employee working behind a counter — who we wouldn’t have tipped at all 10 years ago — might seem out of hand,” he said. “Other people are happy to tip a dollar or two for a $4 cup of coffee to express appreciation to these workers.” 

There is also a class aspect to tipping: Tipping has roots in those medieval aristocratic customs, after all. Politicians need to appeal to both the middle class and the working class — even if members of either group don’t see themselves that way — and they instinctively know that the issue of tipping overlaps with many social and economic issues. 

Service workers — those who would benefit from outlawing taxes on tips — are American heroes. They showed up during the pandemic, in person, when millions of office workers were able to work from the safety of their homes. And they paid the price. (One study found that labor, retail and service workers accounted for 68% of deaths in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.)

While it’s nice and often necessary to tip low-income workers so they can supplement their income, critics play the “what about?” game. Tipping government workers or doctors and nurses, for instance, would raise ethical concerns.

If choosing not to tip makes you look like a fascist (at worst) or a penny-pincher (at best), and if tipping culture in 21st-century America is the ultimate expression of European socialism and democracy — spreading wealth and trying to act fairly and equitably — it’s odd that it’s now more prevalent in America than in Europe, but it also explains why it’s seen as both a solution to and an enabler of low wages for service workers. 

Don’t underestimate the power of tipping. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that exempting tips from federal income taxes and raising the minimum wage — which was also part of Harris’s proposal — would increase the federal deficit by $100 billion to $200 billion over 10 years. For both parties, it must be worth it for the votes as well as the money it puts back into the economy. 

Tipping is a mercurial, class-ridden issue that creates awkwardness in restaurants, reverberates through our broader culture and directly affects the lives of service workers and the industries — restaurants, hotels, cruise lines, strip clubs — that employ them.

It may seem like merely a populist talking point but, as politicians know, your stance on tips can say an awful lot about you.

Where It Matters Most.,No disponible,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/kamala-harris-dnc-speech-economy-taxes-markets-a3916fc8?mod=search_headline,"Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for president in Chicago on Thursday evening, pledging that building the “middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.”

If Harris manages to succeed in her lightning campaign to win the presidency after President Joe Biden’s stumbles, it will be seen as a kind of political miracle. But it would also go some way to repudiating the idea that the voting public is seething over economic slights. After 1968’s disrupted Chicago Democratic convention, Richard Nixon drew on the chaos to claim the silent majority was on his side. More than 50 years later, it could be a Democrat’s turn to claim that mantle.

Few economists expected that the country could avoid a recession by now, but buoyed by debt-financed support from the government, consumers have kept on spending, and businesses have continued hiring. Should Harris be elected on Nov. 5, she’ll likely see it as a mandate to extend and expand Biden’s economic agenda, rather than as a call to redirect the course of the nation—as her opponent does. 

ELECTIONS 2024
Trump and Harris Hear From the Megadonors. What The Big Money Wants in Return.

Biden’s legislative efforts focused on spending for infrastructure and green energy. While not as left-leaning as some of her former colleagues in the Senate, Harris may put a more progressive twist on Bidenomics and has signaled that she may use tax and spending powers to favor lower-income workers and disfavor the savings of the affluent. 

It’s hard to know how far she will go to implement these ideas. Harris has been employing what a former Biden aide called “strategic ambiguity,” taking advantage of the rapid campaign to avoid getting pinned down on specific policy commitments. But it seems, based on what Harris has said so far on the campaign trail and in her convention speech, that her emphasis is on using government authority to ease concerns about the cost of living. 

That may interfere with corporate profits. To investors, this might sound like a recipe for weaker stock market returns. But not so fast. 

To implement her agenda, Harris will need the Democrats to control the Senate, and that seems unlikely at this stage. Plus, the growth of the U.S. debt will put constraints on what she, or any president, might be able to accomplish. And coming changes in interest-rate policy by the Federal Reserve are likely to be more consequential for the markets, at least in the near term.

Harris also has important allies in the investment community. “She’s always been supportive of business,” said John W. Rogers, Jr., chairman and co-CEO of Ariel Investments. He chairs the Economic Opportunity Coalition, a public-private partnership formed by Harris to help drive investments in underserved communities. “She is not off on some kind of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders tangent,” Rogers said.

And it should be noted that Biden, too, has had his share of left-wing rhetoric, including calling in 2020 for the nation to “transition from the oil industry.” But under his presidency, oil and gas stocks have outperformed as the U.S. has become the greatest producer in the history of the world.

When markets and politics collide, the results aren’t always what you’d expect on the surface.

The Plan for the Middle Class

In her speech at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, former first lady Michelle Obama called Harris “one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency.” Harris, 59, has had a lengthy career in government, serving as San Francisco’s district attorney, then California’s attorney general and a U.S. senator, and since 2021, Biden’s vice president.

Absent from that resume, however, is business experience or direct management of economic policy. Nor has it been easy to determine where Harris stands on key economic issues. In the weeks since she became the Democrats’ presidential candidate, her campaign has signaled that she has dropped some of the more progressive positions she pushed for as a candidate. She no longer supports banning fracking or endorses Medicare for All. She has dropped a plan to raise taxes on people earning above $100,000 a year, joining Biden in putting that threshold at $400,000.

Harris’ initial foray into economics as the Democratic nominee elicited mixed reactions, even from some Democrats. In a speech in Raleigh, N.C., on Aug. 16, she detailed a set of economic-policy prescriptions, which read much like what might be expected from a former prosecutor: “Believe me, as president, I will go after the bad actors,” she said, promising new laws to crack down on price gouging by retailers. 

Critics immediately wrote off her idea to impose restrictions on how grocery stores set prices in emergencies as price controls, although in practice what she is proposing is more limited than the wage and price limits Nixon famously imposed, and would need to be passed into law by Congress.

Her tax-related plans may be more consequential. Key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a hallmark of the Trump era, expire next year, including lower marginal income-tax rates on most earners. Harris would extend those cuts below the $400,000 level. She would also impose new forms of wealth taxes—just as Biden had planned. Like him, she would propose to raise the corporate tax rate from 21%, where it was set in 2017, to 28%. 

Harris has also proposed new benefits focused on housing and families with children. The housing plan would aim to improve regulation to spur production of new affordable homes, and would subsidize down payments for first-time home buyers. There aren’t enough details yet to fully assess that plan, though the nation urgently needs more housing supply. But handing cash to home buyers—in this case, a proposed $25,000 per home buyer—might serve to drive up prices.

The child-focused tax plan is clearer, in part because the Biden administration temporarily enacted parts of it during the height of the pandemic. The plan would establish a permanent $3,600 a year tax credit for families with children, and would create a new benefit of up to $6,000 for parents in the first year of a child’s life.

Harris describes this benefit as akin to a tax cut, but it is really something else, said Erica York, senior economist at the Tax Foundation, an independent think tank. “We’re talking about households that don’t even owe taxes in the first place. It’s providing them a net benefit from the federal government that just happens to be administered through the tax system,” she said.

Footing the Bill

How would the Harris administration pay for it? Asked that by a reporter on Aug. 18, Harris said, “I think it’s a mistake for any person who talks about public policy to not critically evaluate how you measure the return on the investment. When you are strengthening neighborhoods, strengthening communities, and, in particular, the economy of those communities and investing in a broad-based economy, everybody benefits, and it pays for itself in that way.”

For that to be remotely possible, the investment needs to be funded. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates Harris’ new policies would cost roughly $1.7 trillion over 10 years. They would likely spur growth in the economy, although potentially at the risk of driving up inflation.

How that nets out for the deficit isn’t obvious. The deficit for fiscal 2024, ending Sept. 30, is expected to be roughly $2 trillion, or about 7% of gross domestic product. It will then stay in the 5-6% range indefinitely if nothing changes.

Biden had campaigned on a set of fiscal pledges that would in aggregate be roughly neutral for the budget, according to the CFRB. Now Harris is adding costs, which could push her further into the red. But because her campaign hasn’t said what other spending it’s committed to, it’s impossible to make a precise calculation.

Harris’ child-focused policies will be tempting for lawmakers. A version of this plan that was temporarily enacted under Biden cut child poverty in half. Still, the national debt now stands at 99% of gross domestic product. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that next president is likely to oversee a rise in the debt above its record set at the end of World War II.

Harris’ team could argue that the debt isn’t an acute crisis, and they would be right. The yield on 10-year Treasuries hit a 52-week low on Wednesday, and is 1.2 percentage points below its peak last fall. If the bond vigilantes are out there, they’re laying low.

The economy grew by 2.8% in the second quarter, and it’s conceivable that strong growth could eventually solve the debt problem—but only if political leaders make the difficult choice to stop adding to the spread between revenue and spending. At least in its early days, the Harris campaign shows little inclination to do that. 

Even the commitments made thus far box her in on the deficit, said the Tax Foundation’s York. “If you’re not going to raise taxes on roughly 98% of taxpayers, and you’re limiting yourself to 28% on the corporate rate, there aren’t a lot of other places to go,” she said.

Barron’s asked the Harris campaign how it would square its commitments to reduce the deficit with the benefits and tax levels it has proposed, and it arranged an interview with Bobby Kogan, a former advisor to the director of the Office of Management and Budget under Biden-Harris who is now with the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. 

“Harris’ agenda is presumably happening through budget reconciliation,” Kogan said, referring to a legislative process that allows fiscal policy to pass the Senate with just 50 votes but puts heavy restrictions on new spending. “Through reconciliation you can’t do long-term deficit increases.”

And Biden’s spending record is better than it seems when you look at the primary deficit, which strips out interest payments on the debt. “Every single year in the Biden-Harris administration the primary deficit got better,” Kogan said.

How Markets Could Be Hit

Meanwhile Harris’ policies could have other potentially troublesome consequences for the economy and markets. 

A higher corporate tax rate could hurt stock market returns, said Aniket Shah, who leads Washington research for Jefferies Group. “If you run any scenario through a financial model and you change the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, there’s nothing more significant that we can talk about that would impact the stock market than that,” he said.

Higher corporate taxes could also trim wage and job growth. 

Harris is also signing up for controversial elements of Biden’s tax plan, notably including a plan to tax some unrealized capital gains as part of an effort to ensure that the ultrawealthy pay their “fair share.” How that policy would work isn’t clear, such as what happens if gains that have been taxed later disappear. Critics argue that it could hurt start-ups in particular, which are prone to shifting valuations.  

But saying something on the campaign trail isn’t the same as passing it into law. Tobin Marcus, a former Biden aide who is now head of politics and policy at Wolfe Research, sees the Harris campaign as being engaged in “strategic ambiguity.” It wants to show voters that it cares about their issues, while not committing to many policy specifics it might regret. “This means that Harris’ campaign policy agenda will offer investors unusually poor signals about the policy outlook if she wins,” Marcus wrote in a note to clients.

Analysts expect that the party that wins the presidency will also win control of the House of Representatives, although the Senate is likely to turn Republican either way. There are no obvious opportunities based on current polling for Democrats to win seats from Republicans, and at least two races—in West Virginia and Montana—where Republicans are likely to flip a seat. Democrats now have 51 Senate seats, so losing two would flip the chamber’s majority. 

The makeup of Congress matters far more for policymaking than whatever Harris says in campaign mode, said Marcus. “Harris’ Office of Management and Budget in 2025 could write down whatever they want on taxes, and it doesn’t really make a difference,” Marcus said. “The question is, what can you get Congress to agree to? I don’t think that anything she will do in terms of either prioritization or negotiation is really going to change the likelihood that the 12th-most-centrist Republican senator is going to agree to raise the corporate tax rate.”

A team at Morgan Stanley 

MS

1.87%
 has tried to puzzle through that question, said Michael Zezas, the company’s head of U.S. public policy research. They looked at what the median Democrat and median Republican would support in terms of fiscal policies in next year’s tax debate. “The rough number that we estimate in terms of deficit expansion in a Democratic sweep scenario would be about a $600 billion spread over 10 years. Contrast that to a Republican sweep, where we do the same exercise, and it’s about a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion spread over 10 years,” he said. In other words, both would raise the deficit.

Harris’ new policy rollout doesn’t substantially change that, he said. 

In the event of a Harris victory, Zezas said, investors can expect the status quo—and that hasn’t been all bad. Despite the black mark of inflation on the Biden administration’s record, it has overseen wage growth that is now outstripping the increase in costs, along with a healthy job market and a booming stock market.

There are few obvious policies that Democrats would want to enact through presidential executive actions that Biden hasn’t already taken, Zezas said. On trade, for example, “we wouldn’t expect to see incrementally any new tariffs that would be substantially disruptive to the economy. Immigration policy choices are probably relatively consistent, as well,” he said.

In other words, in Zezas’ view, “a Democratic win mostly means that investors largely should stay focused on the debate about where we are in the economic cycle and the interaction of growth, inflation, and the Fed, less so on political choices out of D.C., at least for 2025.” 

Some prominent business leaders are endorsing Harris as the candidate of continuity. “Business requires stability and certainty,” former American Express 

AXP

0.81%
 CEO Kenneth Chenault said at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday. “Kamala Harris understands that government must work in partnership with the business community. She understands that a market-based economy needs a strong and effective government.”

Rogers, of Ariel Investments, argues that Harris will improve a regulatory push that has often stumbled under Biden. “Her key appointees, I expect, would be moderate and not susceptible to the kind of drama that has occurred,” he says. “In particular, there have been a lot of court cases that have challenged some of the regulatory decisions that have happened during this administration.”

Given Harris’ experience personally prosecuting antitrust cases as California’s attorney general, Rogers expects her to do better at avoiding regulatory overreach. 

The Biden-Harris administration’s theory has been that forcing large companies to compete would unleash economic gains, but as Rogers alluded to, that effort hasn’t notched up many major successes. 

“As President,” Harris pledged in Chicago, “I will bring together labor and workers and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like healthcare and housing and groceries.”

Harris is trying to say, essentially, that she’ll be Biden but better. She’ll use the power of government to help keep down the cost of living, after the administration she joined helped ignite the inflation problem. 

That might seem like another era of big government, but to be sure, her opponent is offering one too. Trump is promising an aggressive version of economic populism that would hike tariffs in an attempt to give him global leverage while cutting taxes in ways that would outstrip Harris’ conceivable contributions to the deficit. 

It will be for voters to decide which of the two they prefer.

What Economists Are Missing.,No disponible,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/fed-rate-cut-recession-credit-cycle-economy-a005d11b?mod=search_headline,"About the authors: Edward Yardeni is president and chief investment strategist and Eric Wallerstein is chief markets strategist at Yardeni Research.

Tightening monetary policy did not cause a recession during 2022 and 2023, and, we believe, is unlikely to cause one in 2024 and 2025. The reason is what we call the Credit Crisis Cycle. It also means the Federal Reserve should not be in a rush to lower interest rates this year, making us an outlier among the chorus of calls for rapid rate cuts to loosen the restrictiveness of monetary policy. 

Monetary theories of the business cycle ignore the credit cycle, rendering them incomplete. These models chalk up the financial crises that trigger credit crunches to one-off aberrations, despite their recurring nature. The monetary cycle is widely studied and receives plaudits from academia and the financial media. The credit cycle, however, gets little respect, despite its importance to market practitioners and key role in setting off bear markets. We believe that the credit cycle explains more about the relationship between the Fed and the economy—and importantly how higher interest rates cause recessions—than monetary theories. 

Recessions are caused by credit crunches. Monetary tightening cycles usually break in the financial system. The elevated policy rate triggers a financial crisis, which then rapidly morphs into a credit crunch. In a true crunch, even highly rated borrowers struggle to receive financing and therefore retrench, slowing spending and investment. The result is a recession. 

In the past, the Fed raised the federal funds rate during monetary tightening cycles until a financial crisis was triggered. That forced the Fed to reverse course and lower rates swiftly to stabilize the credit system. However, by then, it was too late to avert a credit crunch. That is why the yield curve has historically rapidly disinverted just before a recession. 

Inverted yield curves don’t cause recessions. In 2019, we wrote a study titled, “The Yield Curve: What Is It Really Predicting?” We concluded: “In our opinion, the yield curve, first and foremost, predicts the Fed policy cycle rather than the business cycle. Our research confirms this conclusion. More specifically, inverted yield curves don’t cause recessions. Instead, they provide a useful market signal that monetary policy is too tight and risks triggering a financial crisis, which can quickly turn into a credit crunch causing a recession.” That’s the central proposition of our Credit Crisis Cycle theory. 

The yield curve inverts in anticipation of falling dominoes, from higher interest rates into a recession. Tightening monetary policy raises short-term rates, but bond investors lock in long-term rates in expectations that the Fed will ease once a financial crisis is sparked. If there is no crisis and the Fed is cutting interest rates for monetary maintenance, then the yield curve can disinvert without a recession. 

Unemployment soars when credit crunches cause recessions. The unemployment rate tends to bottom when the monetary tightening cycle triggers a financial crisis. It soars when the crisis turns into a credit crunch and a recession. 

According to our Credit Cycle Theory, the Sahm Rule is a “statistical regularity,” as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at his press conference on July 31. The rule indicates the start of a recession when unemployment rises quickly above a certain threshold. Those conditions were met as of the July jobs report. Historically, the rule has triggered when financial crises start to weaken the labor market. The rule is likely giving a false positive this time around if no financial crisis arises from higher interest rates.

So far, that’s an accurate depiction. The Fed and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. managed to stop last year’s mini-banking crisis from turning into a credit crunch by constructing an emergency lending facility and guaranteeing all deposits, at SVB and Signature Bank 

SBNY

1.38%
, respectively. Thus, no recession has emerged; in fact, credit conditions are loosening. 

The long-and-variable lags of monetary policy are a myth. There are no long-and-variable lags between the tightening of monetary policy and recessions. The lags theory implies that the rise in interest rates takes a while to depress interest-sensitive demand, especially in housing and autos. From our perspective, it may take a while for higher rates to cause a financial crisis, but once it happens there is nearly no lag before a recession occurs. That’s unless the Fed successfully averts a credit crunch. The central bank has become quite adept at playing Whac-a-Mole, using its balance sheet and emergency liquidity facilities to quash crises before they metastasize into credit crunches. 

The economy is less interest rate sensitive. One reason financial crises are less likely to emerge is because the economy is less interest-rate sensitive than in the past. More consumers are retiring and spending their accumulated savings—and increasingly on services rather than goods—while more capital is invested in high tech equipment and software. If rising interest rates don’t cause a credit crisis, the economy is likely to remain surprisingly resilient. 

We believe that the Fed has succeeded in normalizing interest rates at levels that are unlikely to cause a recession. There is no need to rush to lower interest rates rapidly, as was necessary in the past after something broke in the financial system. This time the Fed has averted the crisis phase of the credit cycle, which has been widely ignored by most economists, including those at the Fed.

importance of emergency funds in financial stability,marketwatch,Economy Policy Is Changing. Harris and Trump Are Playing a New Game.,No disponible,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/politics-economics-trump-harris-ideology-3a4a1368?mod=search_headline,"Economic policy has become a grab bag, Larry Hatheway writes in a guest commentary. PHOTO: NDRES KUDACKI/BLOOMBERG

About the author: Larry Hatheway is a co-founder of Jackson Hole Economics, which originally published a version of this commentary, and the former chief economist of UBS.

In the once-popular arcade game Whac-a-Mole, the object was to smack down as many moles emerging from their dens as possible with a mallet. By design, the game rewarded those with the quickest reflexes.

Whac-a-Mole involved neither strategy nor analysis. It was merely a game of quick reactions.

Among both major U.S. political parties, Whac-a-Mole has become the apt metaphor for economic policy. Gone are the days when the political right and left could be distinguished by competing theories: free market, monetarist, or Keynesian. Today, economic policy is mostly a grab bag from which policy interventions are found to address specific economic grievances. No overarching economic theory guides either party’s approach to policymaking.

That might sound like a pithy complaint from an economist about the poor state of U.S. politics, and perhaps it is. But even more, it is an indictment of the economics profession which has struggled for more than a decade to offer compelling narratives about how citizens and those whom they elect should consider the conduct of economic policy.

In the immediate postwar era, the mission was clear—avoid the mistakes of the 1920s and 1930s that led to ruinous conflict. In the West, the rising threats posed by communism, the Soviet Union, and its presumed allies, were also important considerations.

The economic prescription focused on growth, stability, and openness. The policy imperatives to ensure growth focused on low taxes and light regulation, except for banking and finance, which were more heavily regulated. Stability was to be assured by sound fiscal and monetary policies, as well as Keynesian tools to smooth business cycles. International trade was promoted, underpinned by new international organizations, including the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank.

Over time, differences emerged along political lines. Republicans favored lower taxes and less regulation, whereas Democrats promoted policies aiming for greater equality of opportunity. But the differences were arguably minor, epitomized by President Richard Nixon’s famous 1971 adage that “We are all Keynesians now.” 

Stagflation in the 1970s (the coincident outcomes of high inflation and high unemployment) initially created an opening for new approaches to economic policy. These approaches resoundingly won at the polls and in the narrative by President Ronald Reagan, who argued for sound money, low taxes, and light touch regulation. But by the 1990s, Democrats, led by President Bill Clinton, adopted many of those same policies, plus fiscal discipline. Underscoring the reconvergence of economic ideology across party lines, by the end of the 1990s all the talk was of the “Washington consensus,” an approach that argued prosperity and stability could be achieved via orthodox monetary and fiscal policies, alongside vigorous engagement in international trade.

The Washington consensus, however, was never quite as widely fancied within the economics profession as it was amongst politicians. It is not that economists disagreed with the merits of independent central banks tasked with keeping inflation low, deregulation, or increased globalization. Rather, the economics profession noted that those pillars, while necessary for growth, shared prosperity, and stability, were not sufficient to achieve those outcomes.

By the early 1980s, for example, many economists (alongside their scientific brethren) were beginning to sound the alarm about climate change, biodiversity loss, and other important externalities. By the 1990s other economists were beginning to question growing financial imbalances in the global economy. And by the early 2000s yet other economists were beginning to speak of winner-take-all industries, concentrated at the cutting edge of innovation, and outcomes that might lead to greater income inequality.

The 2008-2009 global financial crisis and the 2010-2013 euro zone crisis shattered the Washington consensus in the U.S. and abroad. Faith in free markets, in the singular focus on inflation-fighting monetary policy, in globalization, and in the overall rules of the game were ripped apart by the crisis, as well by the policy response to it. This response largely bailed out rich financiers, but not ordinary homeowners and workers. In Europe, the financial crisis led many to question the wisdom of Germanic fiscal orthodoxy, as well as in the efficacy of the EU itself.

The rest, to use the worn refrain, is history. A history now 15 years in the making, where political parties, as well as ordinary citizens, having rejected the broad postwar and millennium consensus ways of thinking, have struggled to find overarching economic credos upon which to base policymaking decisions. 

As noted at the outset, the economics profession has similarly failed to come up with a compelling narrative that could provide a framework for addressing today’s challenges.

With orthodoxy in tatters, it is not surprising that economic policymaking has become ad hoc—responsive to problems as they emerge. In other words, it has become akin to Whac-a-Mole. 

This is the case with the two U.S. presidential candidates. 

Vice President Kamala Harris responds to concerns from voters about high prices for food or housing by proposing to punish grocery store price gouging, or by promising $25,000 down payment grants to eligible recipients, helping them get on the expensive housing ladder. 

Former President Donald Trump is more transactional, seeking votes by offering to end taxation of tips (which Harris has also endorsed) or by supporting deregulation for industries likely to donate to his campaign, like fossil fuel companies. 

But the simple truth is that it is difficult to discern in either candidate’s proposals a consistent economic framework akin to the belief in free markets, globalization, independent central banking, or fiscal orthodoxy that once were the hallmarks of the two dominant U.S. political parties.

That is partly the fault of the economics profession. The discipline of economics is tasked not only with the analysis of what makes economies work, but also with the development of narratives that convey solutions to those who make policy.

The world is also more complex and less amenable to simple answers than in the past. Gone are the days when outpacing the Soviet Union was the sole economic challenge. Climate change, rising inequality of opportunity and outcome, winner-take-all sectors, monopolistic industrial behemoths, the financialization of politics, and many more facets, make it challenging to offer simple economic maxims as panaceas for what ails our economies and societies.

So, welcome to Whac-a-Mole’s economic policymaking. Don’t expect either candidate to hearken to Friedman or Keynes, much less Smith or Ricardo. Today it is all about reflex, not sweeping ideology.

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Ann Garcia. Ann is a certified financial planner. She’s also the author of the book How to Pay for College. She’s the managing partner of Independent Progressive Advisors, a fee-only Registered Investment Advisor in Portland, Oregon. And she’s also the author of The College Financial Lady blog. She received her BA from the University of California, Berkeley.

Ann, welcome to The Long View.

Ann Garcia: Thank you for having me.

Benz: Thanks for being here. We want to talk about your book, How to Pay for College. In the book, you relate an experience from your advice practice. You were working with an attorney. She wanted to change to a less stressful career path, but she couldn’t because she owed massive amounts of student debt. Can you discuss how that was one of the events that sparked your interest in wanting to focus on helping people make smarter decisions about paying for college and other types of higher education?

Garcia: I would say, she was an extreme example of people that I was talking with. But at the time that I had the conversation with her, and this was a woman who had gone to law school, she had taken out student loans for her undergraduate years, taken out student loans for her grad school years, she had federal loans, she had private loans, and she had even borrowed money from her family. And was really not happy as an attorney and wanted to make a career change, but she was absolutely stuck because of all of those loans. And like I said, she was an extreme example of someone I worked with. And ultimately, our plan was around planning for future insolvency for her, which is when she got to the end of her student loan debt and would have those loans forgiven, that she wouldn’t have to pay taxes on it because she would be insolvent in the IRS’ definition where your debts far exceed your assets and your ability to pay them.

And again, while she was an extreme example, I was talking to lots and lots of young adults who were coming in and interested in making plans but had so little free cash flow after their student loan payments that they were struggling to start a retirement account or even have emergency savings, to say nothing of buying homes or doing all the things that we think of as the standard building blocks of adulthood. And at the same time, there was another group of people that I felt like I was hearing from a lot, and those were parents who were struggling to figure out how they were going to pay for their children’s educations and putting it as a very high priority overall in their goals but not really having an understanding of how they were going to come up with the dollars to do it.

So, I realized that if I could help that group of parents that maybe I could reduce the number of those other young adults that I was talking to. But I would say the attorney really made it very tangible. I knew there were people out there who owed all these student loans. But sitting across the table from this woman and seeing the sense of hopelessness that she felt as a result of getting a great education was very life changing to me, because to me, education has always been a building block of opportunity, of adulthood, and to see that it was completely the opposite for her made a huge impression on me.

Ptak: In the book, you wrote that when it comes to college, no outside entity will protect you from making a terrible financial decision, and then you go on to note that you couldn’t get a mortgage for a house you could never afford, but nothing stops people from borrowing more for college than you can pay back. Why are there fewer guardrails around college outlays, do you think?

Garcia: It’s a great question. On the one hand, the federal student loan programs for students do have some pretty strict guardrails, but nothing prevents students from going and getting additional loans on the private market or parents from taking out parent PLUS Loans. And we as people tend to think that what our children want and need, and particularly the best possible version of that, is worthy of every penny that we have. And, unfortunately, no one will stop you from taking out these loans.

The way that the direct student loan, which is the loan that undergraduate students can take, is structured is, it’s the one loan that an 18-year-old can take without a co-signer, without any kind of credit history and still get a very favorable interest rate. And so, that opens up all these other issues that don’t exist in normal loans. There is no qualification for that loan other than filing the FAFSA. I firmly believe that if there were less loans available to parents, the cost of college would be much lower than it is, because I think that making all those additional dollars available and having an audience that’s willing to spend that kind of money has a huge impact on driving up the cost of college.

Benz: We want to spend some time on deciding whether loans are appropriate and also the FAFSA that you referenced, the application for financial aid. But before we get into the weeds a little bit in college funding, I want to hear about your own experience with this. You wove that in a little bit into your book. You went through the application and college-funding process not too long ago with your twins. So, I’m curious, what were some of the biggest surprises for you, a college-funding expert, as you went through that process with your two children?

Garcia: A great question. There were definitely plenty of them. As much as we can learn—we always learn there’s plenty more out there that we don’t know. So, I have twins who are currently college seniors, and they’re very, very different students. So, their two college application processes were very different. I think to me, one of the biggest surprises, given that I’m a really analytical person and I took a really analytical approach to college and encouraged my kids to see it the same way, I was surprised at how different the responses that they got from different colleges were.

So, for example, my son applied to two colleges. He applied early action to both, which is where you submit your application early, you get an answer early, but you have until the regular decision deadline to make a decision. One of the colleges replied instantly to him with an acceptance and a big scholarship offer and sent him stickers—put one on your laptop, put one on your phone. He was getting emails multiple times a week. Something would come in the mail periodically. And it was just crickets from the other school. And I thought we were going to receive two acceptances and two award letters on roughly the same schedule and be able to sit down and deliberate our way through them. But instead, he was getting this marketing onslaught from one of the colleges and hearing nothing from the other. And for a 17-year-old it was like, oh, somebody likes me and somebody else doesn’t. And it was a very challenging, emotional side of the college application process to deal with.

I think one of the really important lessons for me in going through this with my own kids is that planning for college is equal parts financial planning and parenting. Making sure that your kids understand the process, understand the budget, understand the priorities and what they’re trying to do and that you’re putting some guardrails around their decisions and around their exploration so that you can help them and coach them to good decisions in that process.

I think another big surprise for us was the number of colleges that use unweighted GPA to award merit scholarship. As you go through high school, the schools really encourage students to take higher-level courses, AP/IB, dual credit, whatever it is that the high school offers. That tends to be presented as the best choice in every circumstance. We learned from my son’s experience, where he took a lot of those classes and really struggled in them, they weren’t a good fit for him as a student. So, we were disappointed to see that the college that he chose awarded scholarships on the basis of unweighted GPA. And if we had not pushed him into all these higher-level courses, he would have been eligible for about $12,000 a year more in merit scholarships. I’m not going to say you shouldn’t challenge yourself academically or you shouldn’t take the hardest courses that are available to you. He certainly felt well-prepared as a student when he got to college. But having an extra $48,000 left over because of bigger scholarships would have been a real difference-maker for our family.

Ptak: I think you mentioned your twins are, in addition to being different people, they’re different types of students. How did you approach the college process differently with each of them?

Garcia: I was fortunate that they both wanted different things from the college process. My daughter, we felt, was a really good fit for a private college, a smaller environment, and she was very committed to not going to college around home. And so, we went out and did the whole college tour where we went and visited a whole bunch of colleges. We talked a lot about budgets and funding, because obviously, those were for the most part quite a bit more expensive than our in-state schools. But very much encouraged her to explore those options. One of the things that you find is that just the costs are so different across the board in colleges, and if you’re willing to use cost as one of the lenses that you’re looking at for college, you can find a lot of different opportunities. So, with her, we really explored a range of opportunities and saw that college was available to her at a range of different prices. And we were fortunate that her top choice school accepted her with a great financial aid package, but that involved writing a lot of essays, doing a lot of applications, applying for a lot of different scholarships so that she could close the gap between our budget and some of the colleges that she was interested in.

Our son, on the other hand, was I would say, a very typical boy. He thought school was OK. But he liked sports. He liked having a job. He liked having a girlfriend. So, high school was one of several priorities. And for him we sort of jokingly said, we’ll put as much effort into paying for college as you put into being successful in high school. So, his budget for college was what it would cost him to stay in state. We said, you can probably find some other alternatives besides this, but this is really what the budget is. And he was fortunate to find another option that had a scholarship just for someone like him.

But with my daughter, we used an essay coach to help her with her applications because there were just too many essays that she had to write. We joked it was our winter break vacation insurance just to have somebody else make sure that all got done. We had her do some test prep classes because she was applying to highly selective colleges. She took a full suite of IB classes in high school. With our son, it was the complete opposite. There was an after-school ACT prep class that was free at our high school that he signed up for. He applied to two colleges. He got into both and was perfectly happy with where that ended up.

I will say too now that they’re seniors and they’ve both gone very, very different paths in college, they have each accepted a job for when they graduate, which are virtually identical jobs but for the particular fields of study that they’re in. So, two important points there. One is, everyone can find a path that works for them. And two is, going to a highly selective school versus a highly not selective school does not have a huge impact on what the actual outcomes that the student should expect are.

Benz: I wanted to ask about that, Ann, because the data are fairly clear that going to college delivers a payoff in terms of lifetime earnings and so forth as well as something you talked about in the book: health and maybe even happiness. But where you go, what do the data say about that in terms of outcomes, life outcomes, earnings? The highly selective schools versus less-selective schools, what do we know when we look at the data on that?

Garcia: The data is pretty clear on that where you go to school really is not what’s going to determine who you are as an adult. You can look at big surveys. You can also look at things like where the Fortune 500 CEOs went to college. And the college that produced the most Fortune 500 CEOs is not Harvard, it’s not Stanford; it’s Texas A&M. Every year Rhodes scholarships are announced right before Thanksgiving, and the students who are selected represent an incredible diversity of undergraduate institutions and clearly not just the Ivy Leagues.

There was a great research project that was done a few years ago called the Purdue-Gallup report. In this survey, they surveyed adults who self-rated as successful. So, it’s not we’re only talking to people whose incomes are above X, but we’re talking to people who are themselves successful and satisfied with their lives. And it was all about figuring out how college had informed that success. What they found was there was no correlation whatsoever between what college they went to, what type of college they went to, or any of those “which college” questions about it. Really their success came down to specific experiences that they had in college. So, they were things like feeling like their professors cared about them, being able to apply what they learned in the classroom to the world at large, participating in extracurriculars, finding mentors who could help them explore life paths and whatnot. And I would say, my experience as a parent has been that both of my kids found environments where they engaged and really made the most of their four-year college experience, which is what has led them both to great career paths coming out of two really different colleges.

I encourage parents to think about why college as opposed to which college. So, there are lots and lots of good reasons for students to go to college—higher lifetime earnings. Your typical college graduate will make about $1 million total over their lifetime more than those without a college degree. Unemployment rates are much lower. But there are tons of noneconomic benefits to going to college as well. There’s lower heart disease and type 2 diabetes among college graduates than nongraduates. College graduates marry at higher rates and divorce at lower rates than noncollege graduates. So, there are all sorts of halo effects of getting a college education, none of which is dependent on which specific college you went to.

Ptak: But it will cost you, and that’s something that you talk about in your book, in which you note that the cost of attendance at public universities and private colleges increased by nearly 500% between 1986 and 2016. What are the key factors that has led the college inflation rate to be so much higher than the general inflation rate for the past several decades?

Garcia: It’s hard to point to one specific thing. It’s really a cluster of factors. You could talk about declining state funding, you could talk about increasing administrative costs and not just highly paid college presidents, but also the whole suite of support services that have been deployed across colleges to make sure that kids graduate in four years and move on to productive places in the world—nicer dorms, nicer facilities, upgraded labs, all kinds of things. I personally think that a big reason why the cost of college has gone up so much is that so many people are willing to pay the full price of college. As much as I talk to people about finding scholarships, finding ways to reduce their cost of college, budgeting for college and being realistic about what college costs, the number of people who go into the college application process expecting to pay full price for their child to attend a private school is absolutely mind boggling. And I firmly believe that if we all just decided we weren’t going to pay $80,000 a year for college, college wouldn’t cost $80,000 a year.

Benz: Well, I’m curious, Ann, who’s paying the full freight?

Garcia: Lots of families. Looking at the most selective colleges, anywhere between a quarter and a third of families are not even filing the FAFSA at all. So, they’re going into that expecting that they will pay full price. In my practice, I regularly talk to parents who say, “I know this college costs $75,000 a year, but it’s just perfect for my child and I really want to make that happen.” And it’s shocking to me. There is a large body of people out there who do believe that paying full price for college is perfectly OK.

Fortunately, it’s not the majority of people, and as a result, to fill the rest of those seats at the college, colleges are forced to discount tuition pretty substantially. One of the things that I pay attention to is what’s called the tuition discount rate, and that’s the average rate at which colleges discount their tuition. That rate is actually higher than 50% right now, which means that for every $1,000 of tuition that’s charged, less than $500 is paid. That does not mean that you will pay half of what list price is, but that does mean that if you are willing to look for colleges that offer scholarships for students like your child, you will find them. And in fact, the average net price of college has been pretty flat since the Great Recession, which means that, although published list prices are going up by about 6% a year, the actual amount that people are paying has stayed pretty flat.

Ptak: What role do you think a student’s anticipated career path, to the extent they have one, should play in determining how much to spend on college and whether to take loans to cover it?

Garcia: That’s such a good question because I know there’s that adage of don’t borrow more than your anticipated first-year salary. I would say to that 50% of students go into college undeclared and about 75% change their major over the course of their college career. So, it’s a little bit risky to say, “I’m going in as an engineer and engineers make $75,000 a year average starting salary. So, I’m fine to borrow that much and therefore, I’m going to choose XYZ college as a result.” You may end up being an engineer, but you also might not. And so, making a financial commitment on that basis is, I think, really unwise.

Again, this is me speaking as a parent. I feel like kids are under a lot of pressure when they’re in high school to know what they want to be and to know what their major is going to be and to treat college as a four-year pathway to a career versus an opportunity to really explore broadly. So, to the extent that we are coaching our kids that that’s what they should be thinking as a 16, 17-year-old when they have very little experience or visibility to the world of careers and in particular, a lot of those higher-paying initially fields like engineering, where they, again, don’t have a whole lot of direct experience with what that job looks like, what those courses look like, I think that’s really quite risky.

My recommendation to parents is always that they stick within the limits of the federal direct student loan program for their borrowing. Students who take out that loan every year will graduate from college owing somewhere upward of $27,000, depending on interest rates and how much interest has accrued, and that translates to a monthly payment of around $325 a month for 10 years. That’s an amount that a college degree will almost always cover. In fact, very few students who earn a bachelor’s degree and take out federal direct student loans, very few of them are among those groups of people who really struggle with student loans.

Benz: You talk about that in the book, Ann, who is struggling with student loans. Can you characterize those individuals? What sorts of decisions they’ve made? What sorts of career paths they’ve chosen, and so forth?

Garcia: Absolutely. I feel like, if you listen to the news, you think taking out a student loan is a one-way ticket to the poor house. And for a lot of students, student loans are the difference between going to college and not going to college. So, there’s definitely a universe where that’s an OK decision, and to me, that’s those students who take out that direct student loan and graduate with a reasonable amount.

The people who are really struggling with student loans fall into three categories. One is people who go to graduate school. With graduate school, you can borrow up to the full cost of attendance. Many students go into graduate school still owing on their undergraduate loans, and they end up like my attorney/client from years ago where the interest keeps accruing on those loans while they’re in college, and they graduate owing well into the six figures. We tend to think of doctors and attorneys when we think of those people with tons and tons of student loan debt and say, well, they’re going to have careers that will allow them to pay it off. But there are an increasing number of career paths that require advanced degrees. Social work, physical therapy in many states requires a doctorate, veterinarians. All kinds of career paths that don’t have anywhere near the salary expectations of doctors and lawyers and there are loads and loads of people who are in well over their head on student loan debt from graduate school.

Another group is people who go to college, take out loans, and then don’t graduate. So, those are people who have that student loan debt but don’t have the earnings power that goes hand in hand with having earned the degree. The third group is people who attend for-profit colleges, and those are the colleges that you hear about in the news for their predatory lending practices, they might be schools for massage therapy, or cooking schools, or places where you go to get a technical degree, where in many cases, the degree that a student earns from those colleges is not worth the paper that it’s printed on. Nonetheless, they’re allowed to take out student loans to go there, and they come out fortunate to be able to find minimum-wage-level work, but with oftentimes graduate-school-level student loan debt.

Ptak: What’s your take on whether parents should take on debt to help pay for their kids’ college? Do you think that’s ever a good idea?

Garcia: There are very limited circumstances, I would say, where that makes sense. I generally try to discourage it because most parents are in their 50s when their student comes out of college. And if you come out of college in your 50s with student loan debt and maybe still having a mortgage and trying to make your retirement catch-up contributions, something is going to fall by the wayside. I just feel like the timeline for parents to pay off student loans is really not favorable.

There are a few instances where that could make sense. For example, a parent who’s much older. I had a client whose dad was 71 when the daughter went off to college. The family didn’t have a lot of money. But because of quirks in the FAFSA formula, they weren’t eligible for the financial aid that they should have been eligible for. And in their case, what they ended up doing was having dad take out Parent Plus loans for college, get into an income-based repayment program, defer the loans as long as possible. And he’ll make a payment of about $60 a month for the rest of his life and then those loans will retire with him.

Another group of parents who might consider taking out loans are parents who are eligible for public service loan forgiveness. So, for example, a parent who’s a teacher or who works for a nonprofit, Parent Plus loans can actually be consolidated into direct consolidation loans, and then the parent can get into the income-driven repayment program and then make payments for 10 years and have the loan balance forgiven. It can be a bit of a risky strategy because the parent needs to be sure that they have at least a 10-year career path following their child’s graduation, so after they are able to consolidate those loans and go into repayment and get that forgiveness. Because otherwise, they’ll make income-driven payments and then be stuck without the forgiveness and with the larger balance that goes along with that.

Sometimes for parents who are quite young, it can make sense just because they haven’t had the earnings power maybe over the course of their child’s lifetime to save in high amounts. Sometimes families will talk about strategies that they might use, like a lower-income family, where the grandparents have a bunch of money and would be willing to help the student with college but taking that help might impact their financial aid. Sometimes those families will have the parents take out loans and the grandparents repay them once they’re graduated. But by and large, the direct student loan for students is really the best place to go for borrowing. And I tell parents too that even if the parent intends to be the one paying for college and being the one paying for the loan, it should still be the student who takes out the loan. There’s a couple reasons for that. One is that the direct student loan has the lowest fees and the lowest interest rates of all the federal loans. Another is that the student is more likely to be at an income level where their student loan interest could be deductible, and that could be roughly equivalent to one month’s payment every year, and it can help the student to build credit as well.

Benz: I want to stick with parental finances for a second longer. A perennial issue in households where parents have children is how to balance their own retirement savings alongside saving for college. I know there’s always that visceral pull on the part of so many parents to send their kids wherever their hearts desire. But what are practical strategies for parents balancing those two expensive financial goals?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s such a delicate balancing act too, because as you’ve seen, for a lot of parents, college is such a tangible thing and retirement is this very nebulous far off, I don’t know what that looks like, I don’t know what I want to do.

Benz: Right.

Garcia: But I do know that I want my kid to go to college in 2031. So, a couple of things. One is, I think, that we as advisors need to step away from the two most common pieces of advice that we give—one is, don’t save for college; save for retirement. You can take out loans for college, not for retirement. That’s how we ended up with a trillion dollars in outstanding student loan debt. But the other thing that advisors tend to tell families is, “You want your child to go to private school, well, private school costs $80,000 a year. Inflation rate of this, times four years. That means you need to save $2,000 month every month if you want your child to be able to go to private college.” That doesn’t work for families either. So, there needs to be some sort of middle ground.

My recommendation is this: If you don’t have emergency savings, you don’t have college savings. Emergency savings should always be a family’s first priority. Families who are saving for retirement but not maxing out retirement shouldn’t contribute more than 10% of what they’re putting toward retirement into college. So, if you’re saving $10,000 a year for retirement, you should not save more than $1,000 a year for college. If you want to save more for college, then save more for retirement in addition and move those two up together. Once parents are maxing out on retirement savings, then they have more flexibility to add to their college savings. The things that families can do if they’re really not able to contribute as much as they’d like to to savings—most 529 plans have a gifting page that you can share with family and encourage them to be making contributions to that account. I also encourage families to every year on their child’s birthday look at their budget, think about who their child is becoming and who they want them to become in the future and use that as an opportunity to bump up their savings rate, even if it’s by $5 a month. The more savings you have, the more choices your child will have. There are loads and loads of pathways through college at whatever amount of savings a family has. So, certainly, if you’re not saving $2,000 a month, you have not eliminated the option of going to private school. And I say that as a parent who never contributed more than a couple of hundred dollars a month to my kids’ 529s and whose daughter is going to graduate from the world’s most expensive private college debt-free in June.

Ptak: Speaking of 529s, I think you think the 529 college savings plan is the best option for saving for college. But there’s a lot of confusion about the interplay, how savings affects financial aid eligibility. What do people need to know about that?

Garcia: And that is, I think, such a big fear for parents that if I save, I’m going to lose out on financial aid. Savings have a very negligible impact on financial aid eligibility. So, there are four components to the FAFSA’s formula for calculating expected family contribution or student aid index. It counts the parents’ income, the parents’ assets, the student’s income, and the student’s assets. The parents’ income is by far the biggest piece of that, simply because of how the formula counts the parents’ income. Any nonretirement savings that the family has, and that includes money in your checking or savings account, it includes taxable brokerage accounts, it includes 529 accounts for all the family’s children. Those are assessed at 5.64% of their value, which means that every $1,000 you have in savings costs you $56 in the financial aid formula. That puts you ahead by $944. So, yes, it will cost you a small amount in financial aid, but it will open up a world of additional choices to your child to have some savings.

Benz: I’m curious, Ann, are there any ways to think about your own household financial picture as you’re embarking on this FAFSA, which you think is really important for everyone to fill out? Any hacks that you can share to make yourself look better on FAFSA?

Garcia: So, I would say, filing the FAFSA is a lot like filing your taxes. If you wait till April 15 and just fill out the form, you’ll probably end up owing a little bit more than you would have if you had thought about it may be back in October and mad"

Jeff Ptak: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Jeff Ptak, global director of manager research for Morningstar Research Services.

Christine Benz: And I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance for Morningstar, Inc.

Ptak: Our guest on the podcast today is personal-finance columnist and author Michelle Singletary. Michelle writes the nationally syndicated column ""The Color of Money,"" which appears in The Washington Post, as well as in dozens of other newspapers nationwide. She's also the author of three personal finance books. The most recent was called The 21-Day Financial Fast: Your Path to Financial Peace and Freedom. Michelle is a frequent guest on TV and radio, and she was host of her own national television program, Singletary Says on TV One. She is a graduate of the University of Maryland at College Park. She has received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Johns Hopkins University, where she earned a master's degree in business and management.

Michelle, welcome to The Long View.

Michelle Singletary: Oh, you're so welcome.

Ptak: To start off, you spend a lot of time answering questions from consumers. Have the various attempts to provide economic relief to people who have been affected by the virus been sufficient in your view?

Singletary: I think for the vast majority of people who received the stimulus payment, it has helped them. I've heard from many people from across economic stratas. So, people who are working low-wage jobs, even professionals who have lost their jobs or their hours have been reduced. And they all said those who have received their payments said it did help with rent or mortgage or paying some bills or food. And so, it was a breath of financial air for them.

Benz: You've been writing a lot about the various glitches that people have been experiencing with respect to these stimulus checks. Can you summarize the state of the state with this today and what some of the main issues and logjams have been?

Singletary: Yes, to the IRS' credit and Treasury's credit, they did have to get a lot of money out to a lot of individuals over a very short period of time. I think the last number I saw was 159 million payments worth $200-plus billion. So, that's a lot of payments in just four or five weeks. But there were a lot of glitches along the way. They created two online tools to help people receive their payments. So, according to the CARES Act, if you filed a 2018 or 2019 federal return, and had a refund, that you were sort of clear sailing--you'd get your money in the same account that you got your refund. If you didn't file because you maybe didn't earn enough income or you were on Social Security or maybe for whatever reason, then you had to use these two different tools.

One is Get My Payment. So say you had to pay taxes for 2018 to 2019. The IRS was not going to be using that bank account. I know it sounds crazy, because everybody has written me like that makes no sense. They have the bank account information. But the IRS interpreted the law is that they had to get your permission to put money in an account, which you gave when you gave them refund information for a direct deposit. So, if you had a tax return, in which you owed, then you had to go to this tool, Get My Payment, which was a disaster when it first launched. I mean, it was glitchy, people couldn't get information in, and then you had to be exact in how you put information in. Like, if you capitalize your street and they have it in their system as a lowercase, it might not have gone through.

And then, the second tool was for non-filers, those are folks who did not file for 2018 and 2019 and didn't have to because they didn't make a lot of money. And so that is now the challenge is to get money to those folks because the IRS doesn't know that they're out there. And so they have to use this tool. Well, a lot of people who probably use it may not have Internet access right now. And then there was another group of federal beneficiaries, those who receive Social Security, or Social Security Disability as supplemental SSI, or veterans' benefits or railroad retirement benefits. Now, that was a disaster. Because IRS and Social Security--their systems don't talk to each other. So, the IRS had to go get information from the Social Security Administration, and it was just--it's still a mess. I'm still hearing from retirees who haven't gotten their stimulus payment for just a number of reasons. Maybe they filed a 2018 return or 2019 return and had to pay. So, the IRS is looking at that information as opposed to Social Security information. So, it's just a hot mess for a lot of people still.

Ptak: One thing that we've seen in this crisis and in previous ones is that people have a hard time amassing an emergency fund to help them through job loss or other financial shocks. Do you think our system should make it easier for people to amass an emergency fund in addition to the incentives we give people to save for retirement?

Singletary: It is definitely an issue. And let me tell you this, we often talk about the lack of savings. And right away people think, Oh, it's lower-middle-income folks who don't have it. But let me tell you that a lot of the people that I work with through my community involvement, make six-figure salaries. They have a 401(k) or a 403(b) and they're saving for retirement and they have no cash cushion. They are living paycheck to paycheck. And so, this pandemic hit them hard too--maybe they have reduced hours, or they are trying to help other relatives and they have nothing to pull from. And so, it's so crucial to have that emergency fund at all income levels. And it's sometimes harder to persuade people who are making good money to save because they've got this fat paycheck that is for the most part covering everything, and they don't feel like they need to put aside money in an account that's not earning anything.

Well, many of those people have lost their job during the pandemic. If you worked in the service industry or hospitality, and maybe you had a middle-level position as a manager or something, and now you're not working, that fat paycheck isn't coming in and now they're eyeing their retirement accounts to tide them over. And so, I'm hoping that they get the message that no matter what you earn, you have to try to save something. And obviously, if you don't make a lot, that's harder; but if you make good money, you need to use this pandemic of what happened as a wake-up call that you need to make sure you have a cash cushion. Even as you're saving for retirement and investing, that you still need to have liquid cash so that you don't have to tap those portfolios before you're ready in your retirement years. Because if you had to tap them now in the markets down, that's heartbreaking that you would have to tap that money.

Benz: That's what I wanted to ask about, because the CARES Act did loosen up the restrictions around tapping 401(k) or IRA assets prior to retirement for people who have experienced hardship related to COVID-19. So, do you think retirement savings should be more accessible prior to retirement, less accessible? I know there are different schools of thought on this topic.

Singletary: You know, I waver on this and I really waver on anything because I'm a very black and white kind of girl. But I think for lower-income families to persuade them to invest for retirement, there has to be a mechanism where they can easily tap that money in times of trouble because they are hit first. When there's a storm, when there's a crisis, they get it first before anybody else. And I've heard from this community; I'm part of this community who say, I don't want to lock up my money in retirement in case I need it. Obviously, we want them to do both--have some savings in retirement. So, I think that we do need to have some things in place. And we do. Many companies allow people to borrow from their retirement. There's a penalty, however, if you take it out, as you well know and many of your listeners know, before you're 59.5.

And so, some of the things that came into place because of CARES Act I think was a good thing. Because the reality is, even though we preach, please don't touch this money; keep it there as best you can. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime major crisis. And I don't think we can wag, or should we wag fingers at people for having to tap that money if they haven't had savings. This is not the time to say you should have had savings. This is the time to make it easier for them to tap the money they need to keep a roof over their heads and food on their table. And so, the CARES Act allows people to pull money out either through a withdrawal or a loan and then, without that penalty, that 10% penalty for the withdrawal. And then it gives them an opportunity to pay it back over three years, whether it's a withdrawal or a loan. And I love that. And with a loan, there are no payments. I think it was six months or a year, I can't recall right now. I think it's a year. So, it gives them time before they have those payments kick in. And I think that was the right thing to do, to let people tap that. And as I've written, now, if you feel like you have to do that, please only take what you absolutely need, because you still got that tax hit facing you, even if you don't have to pay that 10% penalty.

Ptak: Say someone who's listening is in a financial crunch. They've suffered an income reduction or perhaps they've lost their job and don't have enough of a cushion to help them through. What advice do you give people in that situation right now? How can they make the least-bad choice?

Singletary: The first piece of advice may surprise people. I think that you need to take some time to breathe, get some therapy, talk to someone. Because if you've been working all your life and you're a hard worker, which many people are, losing your job or being furloughed, or having your income cut because your hours have been cut, can be devastating to your ego and to your pride. And you need to grieve that. Spend the time that you need to grieve that. And then, don't take too long because now you've got to make some hard decisions. And as I've written in my column in The Washington Post, I thought about this in the sense of an emergency room. And so, I've encouraged people to triage their bills. So, if you've ever been in an emergency room that's been really crowded, you may come in with a sprained ankle, and you might be sitting there for an hour and someone comes in and they are immediately taken to the back and you're sitting there going, wait, wait a minute, I was here first.

But you know in those situations, the hospital does something called triage. They treat the most critical patients first--that person came in maybe having a heart attack. Of course, they should go first. And you need to look at your bills the same way. If you have lost your job at whatever income level, because it's just as devastating if you're making $20,000 or if you're making $200,000, then you need to say, I can only pay the essentials, the necessities--that's roof over your head, food on the table, utilities, and if you have a car loan. So that way you can maybe look for another job or part-time job. And then everything else has to be put on hold, especially your credit card debt. If you've got credit card debt, call the lenders; ask for forbearance or payment pause. I'm not suggesting that you ignore it and not take care of it. But if you don't get help from them and they won't let you--but many have--then you can't pay that bill. And I know for many people that is just heresy, because they're like, ""What? I've always been paying my bills on time."" You got to step out of that. You're in the emergency room now. You are the critical patient with the heart attack, and you can only do a certain amount. Pay what's necessary.

If you've had some disruption of income, but you're still making a good check, try to keep everything going, but only the essentials. Say you had a lot of credit card debt, and you were on an aggressive debt-payment plan where you're trying to get rid of it--pull that back and just make the minimum payments, because you need to free up that cash. And then, if you're working and your income is OK now, this is the time to take maybe those savings that you're having--you're not commuting maybe, you're working from home, you're not eating out, you're not spending on a credit card--take that and build up your savings account and/or increase your retirement savings.

Benz: Well, that's what I wanted to ask about. Do you think apart from the people who are in dire straits for various reasons, do you think that for people who are still working, the current crisis might have some positive side effects in terms of forcing them into some discipline around saving, because there just aren't that many opportunities to go to restaurants and do things that they would otherwise spend money on?

Singletary: Absolutely. There are so many people in this terrible crisis who have seen a silver lining. They have seen their expenses go down, so they actually can see that they have the money to save. Just to give you an example, my niece and her husband, he has some student loan debt, and they're good savers, and they live below their means. But he's got some student loan debt. And they called me up and they said, what should we do because they're offering us this pause, but we have all this extra money because our kids are not in daycare--so they're saving on that. And I said, oh my gosh, don't take that student-loan forbearance; take all that money and pay down that student loan, because right now anything you put on that student loan is at zero-percent interest, which means all your payments go to principal. And I worked out a plan with them that over the next six months they can get rid of that student loan debt by all the savings they have every month--not eating out, childcare, all the things that I mentioned. And so, they were like, are you serious? I said, absolutely. By September, you could have all that debt gone.

And then, there are other people that I've worked with who were out and spending and planning for vacation, right? Lots of people have canceled vacations. They've taken that vacation money--and I have talked to so many people who have gotten out of credit card debt or greatly reduced some of their debt by all the money that they're saving because of the stay-at-home orders.

Benz: I want to talk about financial helps, because I assume that some of our listeners are people who are in good financial shape, but they have loved ones in their lives who are struggling. So, how can they balance helping alongside making sure that they're not jeopardizing their own financial well-being? And this is really an evergreen issue. I'm sure you encounter a lot of older adult parents who are retired who grapple with how much to help adult children. How do you approach that topic of financial help?

Singletary: So, when it comes to financial health, and I'm sure your listeners maybe have heard this analogy, but if you have just act like you haven't heard it before. So, when I was a new parent, for the first time I flew on an airplane with my infant child, I remember the flight attendant saying: When the oxygen mask drops down, if you're with a child--or somebody acting like a child--to put your mask on first and then attend to your child. And my motherly instinct right away was like you are out of your mind. I am going to take care of my child first. And as they kept going with the instruction, she said: Because if you're gasping for air, you're both going to pass out because you then won't be able to help your child or yourself. And that's the same thing with your financial health. You have to first make sure that you've got your emergency fund, that you have your financial house in order, and that you're saving for retirement--you've done all the things, you're paying down your debt. And then, if you have extra--and many people do--you give from that extra. You give from your abundance, because you can't forgo paying your mortgage payment or your rent payment or something to help someone else. Make sure you're financially healthy because then maybe they come live with you. And so, that's what I tell people. Give out of your abundance, give out of your extra. And you ought to actually have a plan for that all the time.

My husband and I have always had a ""give out of our extra"" fund. We actually have a bank account where we put money in to help relatives. Certainly, no one could predict it--well, I guess some people did predict the pandemic--but there are times when you know that people that you love, and friends and family, are going to be in financial trouble. And if you are that person who has a giving heart, then just plan for it. And so, once you've taken care of your financial health, you're making sure that you've got your oxygen mask on, then come up with a plan to help other folks. Because you don't want to give so much that it hurts you. But you also don't want to enable bad behavior. But right now, people are in such dire need, I think you need to not worry about whether somebody was financially irresponsible. You need to just reach out and help.

And if you're concerned they might not use the money properly, what we do is when we help people, we pay the vendors or the creditors directly. So someone you know has lost their job, and they can't make their rent, just pay the rental office yourself if you're worried about someone who may not have been financially responsible. But I really do believe that this day and this crisis, that if you can, you should, because I truly believe to whom much is given much is required.

Benz: I want to talk about wealth and income inequality, because COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on people of color, not just in terms of the virus, but also in terms of the economic impact. So, you recently wrote an article in which you argued that coronavirus could widen the already-wide wealth gap for people of color, especially with regard to housing wealth. So, let's talk about that. And I'd like to get your thoughts on whether the 2007 through 2009 Great Financial Crisis is instructive in terms of what we should expect to see this financial crisis.

Singletary: Right. So, I wrote about a report out of the Urban Institute Housing Policy Center. And so, they were looking at past crisis, past storms, and how they impacted homeownership for African Americans. And they looked at the Great Recession and Hurricane Katrina--Katrina was in 2005 and obviously the Great Recession 2007 to 2009. And so, they looked at it and sure enough, it impacted it in the sense that homeownership went down because homeownership obviously is connected to jobs, and we know that in all of these storms--the Great Recession, Hurricane Katrina, and now even COVID-19--that the frontline workers, those low-income workers, many disproportionately made up of African Americans and minorities, they lost their jobs first. And so, they're going to be unemployed longer, and they're going to have a harder time on the back end of this becoming employed again. And so, all of that impacts your ability to get a home loan.

And then, there are other factors--there's still employment discrimination; there's still a huge pay gap. African Americans with the same resume, same job history are less likely to get a call back for a job than white Americans. We see study after study that shows that. And so, they can't recover as fast. And without a job, without employment, without equal pay, it impacts their ability to buy a home. And we know that home equity for most Americans, even though Morningstar is all about investing, but we know that most Americans, their net worth is tied up in the equity in their home.

When I looked at this report, one of the things that was just disheartening is that in 2020 the homeownership rate for African Americans is about the same as it was when housing discrimination was legal. And that's pretty tragic. Because it's through home equity that families are able to leave money to their heirs, maybe borrow from it to help somebody with a down payment, even though I don't recommend that. I'm not a big fan of pulling equity out of your home other than for mandatory home improvements. But yet it is there for you in times of trouble that you can tap. It's one of those things that we say don't go tap your retirement fund; don't tap your home equity. But then there are cases where you do have to do that. Maybe you're not tapping it for yourself, but you're trying to help extended family members, but at least it's there. Well, we do know that because of, again, discriminatory practices, African American homes in similar communities with the same type of amenities don't appreciate the same as that home in a predominantly white neighborhood. We feel that COVID-19, because it hit so quickly and it hit so hard, and we may be dealing with this for another 18 months to two years, it will surely impact the ability of African Americans to buy a home.

Benz: Michelle, I was struck by that same statistic that you referenced that African American homeownership is now about 41%, close to where it was when race-based housing discrimination was legal. So, for some context, the rate of homeownership among whites in the U.S. is over 70%. How does this get better? What are the prescriptions that you favor? Are they policy prescriptions? How do we address this?

Singletary: Well, we address it on different avenues. There has to be a convergence of a lot of things. So, right now, or at least as of 2018, the homeownership rate for African Americans is about 41% and as you mentioned, over 70% for white Americans, I think about 72%. And so, two avenues--one, definitely policy. Perhaps, home down-payment programs to make homeownership more accessible to people who are making; looking at lending and making sure that there's no discrimination in lending. We still don't have as much data as we need to look at to see if there are any differences in the interest rates that are being offered to African Americans. We saw, for example, during the Great Recession, that there was a lot of predatory lending going on. African Americans with the same credit profile, income, everything being as equal as it can be, getting loans at a much higher rate and at those funky mortgages where you could pause a payment and no documentation, and all kinds of craziness compared to white Americans. And so, we need to be sure that homes that are similarly situated in Black neighborhoods are not appraised at a lower value than homes in white neighborhoods. So that's the policy side, encouraging--and I should add this in, just affordable--housing for one thing; it's not just having the policies in place but making sure people can get homes at an affordable rate.

And then, on the personal side, obviously, more financial literacy, trying to help people understand when is the right time to buy a home. Like right now, one of my top questions people are asking me is should I buy a home, the interest rates are low, the prices are down. And my standard answer is, you should buy a home when it's the right time for you to buy a home. Don't look at the interest rate, don't look at what the market is doing, because none of that's going to matter if you're not prepared for that mortgage. And when I say prepared, now, I'm rough, right? I'm rough. People don't want to ask me should they buy a home, because I'm going to just hurt your little heart. So, if you've got a lot of student loan debt, you've got credit card debt, even a car loan, I just think you should get rid of all of that before you buy a home.

Now, I know people who are listening thinking, well, then none of us will own a home. But I don't want people dragging six-figure student loan debt into a home. I don't want them dragging credit card debt into a home. I want them to have an emergency fund before they buy a home. Because anybody who owns a home knows it's a money pit and you need resources to be able to maintain that home and stay in it when there is a crisis. I don't want you to go into a home when you have so much debt that if a crisis hits and you lose your job, you're going to be in trouble right away. I need you to have a cushion, and that may mean putting off homeownership for a while. I'm a big believer in homeownership, but at the right time. I think that's so important to look at--when is the right time for you to own a home. And oftentimes when we look at homeownership, we compare it to rents and the mortgage. But there is so much more to owning a home. And it's not an even comparison. Because if my toilet breaks, I got to pay somebody to come in. If my heater breaks, I've got to replace that. If you're in an apartment, your landlord is responsible for that. And then in times of crisis, if you can't afford that rent, it's not ideal. And I'm not suggesting you do this if you don't have to, but you can pick up and move. You will still owe that, but you don't owe it right away. You can take care of it, it will be a debt, but you can at least find other housing. You're kind of stuck with a mortgage and it makes it much more difficult to pick up and move to even go where the jobs are if you've got to try to sell a house in a market that's down. And so, I think those are the things that we have to look at when we look at homeownership. But we do know that homeownership is one of the keys to closing that wealth gap among African Americans. It's not the only key; it's not the top key; it's one of the keys.

The other ones we talked about earlier in the interview--employment, making sure there's as much as we can getting rid of employment discrimination and closing the pay gap. All of those things together will help close the wealth gap between African Americans and white Americans. And someone might be saying, why should I care about that? Because let’s be real, people will ask that. Because when we are all able to live well and have a living wage and be able to pass on money to our heirs, we all are better for it. When you have a society where the wealth gap is so huge, we have a situation like we have now--where when those folks fall, it brings all of us down, and we don't want that. There is enough for everybody.

Ptak: You mentioned student debt. For a lot of young people just starting out, taking out loans to fund higher education seems completely logical--the connection between education and income is clear. But how can young people of color thread that needle, investing in education without over-borrowing and saddling themselves with more debt that they can reasonably handle?

Singletary: Yeah, that's a great question. It's a question for everybody, not just African Americans. But we do know that African Americans end up having to borrow more because their family has less to be able to help them with and then when they borrow, they end up not being able to finish because they can't borrow enough. It gets to a point where it's too much and they drop out. So, then they have the debt and no degree, and that puts them further behind. And so, what I try to encourage while we're trying to have policy changes where we need to increase--the Pell Grant, which is the grant for low-income families, we need to have more scholarships and aid, state aid. We know that many states pull back from helping their college systems. So, until that happens--and it absolutely needs to happen--we cannot put all of this on families, particularly minority families who are already struggling for a number of reasons. But what I try to encourage peo"

Jeff Ptak: Hi and welcome to The Long View. I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Christine Benz: And I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: Our guests on the podcast today are Kiersten and Julien Saunders. Together they blog about finance and life at the website richandregular.com. And they’re also the authors of a new book called Cashing Out: Win The Wealth Game By Walking Away. In addition, they co-host the rich & REGULAR podcast. After discovering the Financial Independence, Retire Early movement in 2012, they proceeded to pay off $200,000 in debt and walked away from their corporate jobs before turning 40. Kiersten and Julien, welcome to The Long View.

Julien Saunders: Thank you so much for having us.

Jeff Ptak: It’s our pleasure. Thank you so much for joining. It sounds like, Julien, you discovered the Financial Independence, Retire Early, or FIRE movement, first. Can you talk about that, what you were doing for your career at the time FIRE came on your radar and what appealed to you about it?

Julien Saunders: I believe my first introduction to the movement was during my grad school days. This may have been like the late 2000s and it was really just in between those moments when I was studying and not wanting to study, and I would find myself just venturing on the internet and exploring real estate blogs and wanting to learn about real estate, making money. And somehow that rabbit hole led me to FIRE blogs and that wonderful world that really doesn’t exist anymore and has since evolved into all kinds of multimedia content. But I just found it really fascinating at the time that people were like sharing their net worth and talking about their investment strategies and really evangelizing for this way of life and this way of thinking. And I was just really just fascinated by it.

I had more than one motivation—I think at that time was really just a matter of my interest in all things money and business and wanting to make as much money as possible so that I could have a good quality of life. But when I started looking at that and juxtaposing it against some of my other interests, which were really around social justice issues and wanting to be a positive role model in my family and in my community. I really started to think about creative ways to tie the two together because it felt as if, with respect to the Black community, that we’ve made progress in so many other areas, but wealth seemed to be one of those things that we were lagging behind. And so that’s really when the ball started rolling, I would say around the late late 2000s.

Christine Benz: We want to come back to some of the things you’ve just mentioned, Julien. But Kiersten, I want to bring you in because it sounds like you needed some convincing to proceed on this journey toward FIRE. Can you discuss your evolution? It sounds like you and Julien began to talk about some of these things. Can you talk about where you were and how you came over to embrace this idea of financial independence?

Kiersten Saunders: I definitely needed some convincing. When Julien first brought the idea to me, it was like immediately no—it felt very extreme, and it felt like people weren’t enjoying their lives. And you have to remember back then, at this time I was in my late 20s, I was doing well in my career. I had a very robust social life that included expensive brunches on the weekends. And back then, the blogs were written anonymously and they were really focused on all of the ways that people were saving money and then investing the difference. So, there wasn’t a lot of narrative there. There weren’t pictures and stories like everybody had this pseudonym and code names that they were writing behind. And so, my evolution really started to happen, when I discovered different voices. When I discovered women like Tanja Hester and Paula Pant, that could really paint a picture for me that allowed me to see me embracing some of these ideals without completely removing my identity from my life.

And then this real shift happened when I went to a conference and we actually met people who were financially independent in real life, that weren’t bloggers, but were just living this lifestyle. And that was when the magic happened. I realized that is exactly what I want to be doing. Waking up when I want to, spending my time in a way that’s aligned to my values, and so I was all on board after that.

Jeff Ptak: You two became evangelists for financial wellness and began to pay a lot of attention to how you were managing your household assets. Who or what were your main influences on that journey? You mentioned Tanja and Paula, it sounds like they were pretty pivotal influences. Who or what else influenced you as you made your way on that journey?

Julien Saunders: That’s a great question. I think the first person as I’m thinking about it, I think like a lot of other Americans I remember reading Rich Dad Poor Dad. But I wouldn’t call that an influence it was really just like an entry point and something that introduced me to personal finance. But I will say Dr. Dennis Kimbro who is a professor, but in many ways in the Black community, seen as almost like the godfather of personal finance. He certainly was a huge influence on me. A couple of books that he wrote, Think and Grow Rich, which is a bit of a play on Napoleon Hill’s book, but he added one with a bit of a Black focus, which was really intriguing to me. And it was one that was recommended by several mentors. And the next one was The Wealth Choice where he really just brought it to life and that was important for me because it helped me to more sharply envision myself as some of the people that he was writing about and interviewing and sharing insights into the way that they thought and the way that they managed their money. I don’t know if you had any other influences at the time.

Kiersten Saunders: It wasn’t so much a person; it was more the lifestyle for me. It was more of a what than a who. I’m very reward-driven and so the idea of being able to do things like sleep in, which was at the time very important to me, pre-children. Those were the things that I looked forward to. I looked forward to taking vacations and not having credit card debt on the back end and being able to splurge on the things that matter to us, like I was more focused on the rewards of money.

Christine Benz: You two retired from your corporate careers before you were 40. And I want to talk a little bit about how you did that because there’s this whole gradation of people in the FIRE movement where you’ve got the, I guess they call it Lean FIRE, like the extreme frugality people and then the people who have high incomes that, somehow made their way to FIRE, but maybe they have a little higher-cost lifestyle. How would you plot yourself on that spectrum of FIRE practitioners?

Julien Saunders: For sure the latter end. I’m not a big fan of any of these labels. I really don’t use them because they’re pretty widely accepted within the community and in the media. But, for sure, we credit having high income and discipline as major sources as to why we were able to accomplish what we were able to accomplish. And I just remember thinking at the time, you know when you’re not earning, I remember when I was earning like $40,000 a year and was like the most amount of money that I ever thought and then was earning $75,000 a year and that was like a dream come true. Because I remember reading job descriptions and thinking, what do people who make this much money do with all this money? I just couldn’t imagine it until it actually happened.

Even in those moments I would look up the organization and look around and think about people who made even more. And I just found myself continually asking this question, what are we doing with all this money? And quite honestly, why are they still working? I just couldn’t understand it. But yeah, all that to say, for sure, we were very fortunate to have earned high incomes and we would see people who earned even higher incomes but made very different choices as a bit of a cautionary tale because we didn’t want to be in our 50s and 60s and still needing to work to make ends meet or to help make up for decades past.

Jeff Ptak: As you embarked on your journey to financial independence, were there any key areas where you departed from the conventional wisdom about how to do it?

Kiersten Saunders: I think the biggest area that we departed from was this idea of having a rigid number or a rigid timeline before we considered ourselves financially independent, or maybe a better way to put it is able to take advantage of the benefits of financial independence. So, while traditional, conventional wisdom says you have to have 25 times your annual expenses before you’re financially independent and can quit your job. We realized that even if you don’t have 25 times your annual expenses, there’s still a whole lot of leverage you can do between working every single day for a salary and enjoying a life where working is optional. And so, we’ve decided to pursue a creative career, I guess you can call it a career, after we left the traditional workplace and were able to do that because of the portfolio that we have.

Christine Benz: How did you set your target for how much you would need to have set aside before you could quit those corporate jobs?

Julien Saunders: Well, that part was pretty simple. It was really just a matter of guesstimating how much we think we would need on an annual basis and looking at how much we would need in our portfolio today and then allowing that to compound over a number of decades. It was really just a matter of saying how much is enough, if you will. To be able to say, yeah, we’ll have more than enough based on what we anticipate we would need during reaching our traditional retirement ages, or when we can safely withdraw without penalty from our retirement accounts. It’s a moving target for a number of reasons for us—one because we have a child, and the costs of children is so wildly unpredictable. But even now with respect to supporting a parent—my mom is financially insecure and so we do support her financially today. And we’re lucky that we’re able to do that quite comfortably based on the number of income sources that we have.

And so all of that to say for us it was a matter of being able to reprioritize the things in our life that were important to us, which at this juncture is quality of life, health and our wellness, taking care of our son, spending as much time as we can with our parents in their golden years without having to worry about whether or not we are going to have enough in retirement. And so, we’re in a really comfortable spot right now and we’re still able to earn income, which makes it even a lot easier for us.

Kiersten Saunders: I think the term for our version of FI is Coast FI, where you front-load your traditional retirement and then you’re coasting in between your current age and traditional retirement age and you’re figuring out ways to cover your expenses and continue to invest.

Jeff Ptak: You mentioned enough a moment ago. In a lot of ways, social media seems to work against that concept when it comes to getting off, say the spending treadmill. As we know, social media can be full of people flaunting trappings of wealth. How would you recommend that people deal with that given that social media is a way of life for so many people?

Julien Saunders: It’s a great question. You used the word treadmill and I would say, getting off the social media treadmill is probably one of the best things that you can do, because you’re absolutely right, it sucks you in and it shows you a very curated and mostly false way of life in thinking, and even now we’re finding ourselves spending as little time as possible aimlessly surfing social media because there’s just not a lot of value there. And I think also given our platform, we really want to represent something else. We want to be a real-world example and social media algorithms don’t really cater to that. They want to see the sexy stuff, and the sizzle and all of those things. So, I think if that’s something, if you’re listening out there and you’re thinking that this isn’t something that you enjoy, I think honestly, just consider joining the group of people who actually just decided that they don’t want to do it anymore. And just continue to opt out because it can be very enticing and it’s only getting better or worse. The algorithm is getting better at feeding the things that you don’t want or need, but it’s worse for a lot of people who are spending time there.

Kiersten Saunders: At the same time, there’s the other side of that coin, where social media allows you to find community in ways that you wouldn’t be able to do locally. And for a lot of us who are pursuing countercultural means of financial progress, it’s the only way that you can connect with like-minded individuals through hashtags and communities. And so, I’d offer that piece of advice. You absolutely want to heed Julien’s caution and treat social media like the recreational drug that it is. But while recognizing that through the power of hashtags and challenges and communities, you can also find your next biggest supporter. We tend to lean on our friends and family and expect them to support every endeavor of our lives. But when it comes to money, sometimes that’s not possible and you haven’t met your biggest cheerleader yet or your accountability partner. I would encourage you to use social media for that, to join a couple of communities, tweak the algorithm, tell them you’re interested in money nerd stuff and the kinds of content that you want to see. And then let it work for you.

Christine Benz: That’s a great point. I want to talk about one of the most amazing parts of your story, which is that you had $200,000 in debt, that you were able to pay off in five years once you both got serious about this FIRE thing. Can you talk about that? I’d like to hear specifically if you have any hacks to share with people who have debt that they’d like to pay down in a similarly aggressive way.

Kiersten Saunders: It’s a great question because when we were doing this back in 2012, it was when we started, or 2013, a lot of the apps and tools that exist today weren’t around. And so, our biggest hack was using paper. We had a countdown calendar that we would post on the refrigerator. I bought it off of Amazon—it was like 100-day countdown calendar. And we knew what milestone would be associated with those 100 days. And we could build little celebrations along the way. We knew that, if we were on day 89 in 11 days, we could have a nice bottle of wine or whatever the splurge was. And then the other hack that we used was we would move the money as soon as it came into the account. I remember, we’d wake up on Friday morning, see the direct deposit hit and we already knew where that money was going to go. It wasn’t like we were letting it sit—it went out of the account almost as soon as it came in and we were using the rest of what was left to spend.

Paula has a name for this kind of budget, but you’re basically paying your debt down first and then you have what’s left is your budget. You don’t have to categorize anything; that’s all you have. Those were the two things. It was frequent, we normalized talking about money on a regular basis. We were super engaged with it. We weren’t looking at our debt as a boogeyman. We really looked at it as a creative challenge that we could work together to get rid of.

Julien Saunders: I would add a bit of a counterintuitive hack was to build in many celebrations along the way because it can be such a long and strenuous journey, and Kiersten actually had to teach me to do that because I was much more willing to go the hardcore frugal route. But it can get boring and repetitive. And to build in these little treats along the way really help to make the entire journey feel worthwhile.

Jeff Ptak: Rental properties and rental income had been part of your story for achieving financial independence, and I think that’s the case with many people in the FIRE community. But not everyone is cut out to be a landlord. What should people know before including real estate rentals as part of their financial plans?

Julien Saunders: There’s so much to know. There’s so much to learn. I think for us, because in the early stages I thought that it was going to be something that was a part of our lives forever. But, I was like dead set on it because that’s what I had learned, that’s what I was taught, and it had been role-modeled by so many people. I think one of the lessons that I would say now looking back, and now that we’ve sold all of our rental properties, is that I think you owe it to yourself to just be honest with yourself. To your point, it is not for everyone and that could change. You have to give yourself the right to change your mind. The other thing is I would say is, break the stigma of seeing selling as a bad thing. In order for you to buy property, someone has to sell. I think there’s this obsession with continuing to buy and buy assets. I’m like, all right, someone at some point had to be willing to sell and it doesn’t mean that you’re quitting or giving up. Sometimes you just may decide that this isn’t a good fit for you.

I think if you’re a newbie investor and you’re thinking about it, I think getting over that hump and not seeing selling as some type of failure or some admission of wrongdoing, I think is really important. Take advantage of all of the different perks and flexible options that you have that come with being a real estate investor or landlord, and that includes knowing when to fold them.

Christine Benz: Can you discuss your decision to unload your properties and not be in that business anymore?

Julien Saunders: It was really as we started to engage and think about how we can better leverage some of the skills that we learned in our corporate careers, as entrepreneurs and specifically within the creator economy, which is something that we really started paying attention to about five years ago. And the reality is it was just far more lucrative and far more fun than owning real estate. And so when I started thinking about where I wanted to spend my time and where I wanted to learn and it was like, all right I got to choose between really trying to master my understanding of taxes and insurance or do I really want to explore videography and photography? And so one was just that interest and I just didn’t really find owning or being a real estate investor fun the way that I used to. But secondly, it was just far easier and more fulfilling for me to drive traffic to a website to grow income or to grow a following on social media, it’s just far easier for me to do that than it was for me to raise rent. And far more lucrative. Quite frankly, some of the income that we would earn on an annual basis in one of our rental properties we could earn with content in a day.

So, it just didn’t really make much sense anymore and we started to look at our real estate portfolio as like a dreary bond portfolio. It was just holding me down. And we just didn’t want it anymore. It’s like, why are we doing this? And again, it was just out of this deep sense of commitment that, well, this is what you do when you’re building wealth. You’re supposed to own real estate, and we just found it not to be true. And so real estate led us to FIRE community, the FIRE community led us to the creator economy, and now we’re sort of straddling the fence between the two and it’s a really, really fun place to be.

Jeff Ptak: What steps did you take to protect your own plan against the kind of market downturn we’ve had so far this year?

Kiersten Saunders: I think it was a combination of things. We got a glimpse of the market downturn for a blip back in 2020 when the pandemic started. And at that point, we had a lot of cash on hand from liquidating our real estate and we started to really buckle down and determine what is our baseline budget, what is our, I forget the word for it, but what does Erin Lowry call it?

Julien Saunders: I don’t know, I always think skeletal.

Kiersten Saunders: Yes, but she has like a darker word for it, but like our skeletal budget. We got into a good rhythm during the pandemic because I had just left my job. Things were different. We had a lot of uncertainty. Obviously that little blip only lasted a couple of months. Now we are revisiting back to same practices that we’ve been using for this entire journey. I think the benefit of the FIRE community is that it teaches you how to be lean and creative in times where you don’t need it. So, when the environment, when the markets call for that same shift to happen so that you can free up capital to continue to invest. It feels very natural to you. It doesn’t feel like some sort of punishment or any negative connotation. You just recognize that this is natural, you see it as an opportunity. You welcome the uncertainty to an extent. And it becomes—we keep using the word creative challenge—but it really does become this creative challenge to figure out how to take advantage of the downturn.

Julien Saunders: I think it was also a little bit of just being willing to look back and be better students of your own investing history. Which is to say, we’ve been investing over a decade now. I’ve gone through a number of recessions. And so, you’ve got to really think back and say, well, what did I believe to be true in 2008, 2009, or that I believe to be true the last time we had prior hiccups and what can we learn from that? And in most cases it was really to just hold on, to just keep going, to trust that we’ve seen those gains, while we don’t know if the market will perform the way it did over the last 10 years, it really doesn’t matter. What’s done is done. And what we do know is that we are in a cycle. One of the best things you can do is to not overreact. And to, if anything, reevaluate your investing strategy and if you really trust it, you might even be willing to play a little bit more aggressively, than you did in the last 10 years.

Christine Benz: Julien, you mentioned at the outset of our conversation the racial income and wealth gap, which is a key interest of yours. It’s something we’ve talked about on a few occasions on the podcast as well. People of color have substantially lower net worth than white people. They’re less likely to have investments in the stock market or inherit wealth, and they’re also more likely to be poor in retirement. So, as you’ve studied the issue, what have you concluded? And this is a question for both of you. What do you think are the best ways to move the needle to improve financial wellness among people of color?

Julien Saunders: It is such a sad and big question. When we first started, when I first started really thinking of personal finance, wealth-building as a hobby, as an area of interest, I remembered that gap was somewhere in the ballpark of 6 or 8 to 1 or $6 to $8 for every $1 for Black families and now that number is anywhere between 11 and 13. And so we’ve seen it doubling. We’re seeing wealth inequality get worse and the pace in which it’s growing it seems to be getting faster. We haven’t even begun to see what the impact of COVID-19 and closing of businesses or loss of homes and property or any of those other things may do to make it even worse. What I do believe is that anything that is worthy of being deemed a crisis requires a multifaceted approach and I think that this is without question a crisis. And so, policy got us into this mess by and large and I think policy is going to have to play a role in getting us out of it. And we’ve seen a number of politicians offer some things from baby bonds to…

Kiersten Saunders: Reparations.

Julien Saunders: Reparations and guaranteed income, all of those things. But the last time I checked it certainly does not seem to be a top priority right now. This is where individual responsibility and people on a local level really need to buckle down and start looking at their finances and get more engaged with investing. I think one of the best things that we can do is to really lean into entrepreneurship, if for no other reason than because when done well, there is no cap to your income and that’s certainly not a perk that most jobs can afford us, and that’s why it’s such an important part of our message is to encourage people who are doing well and have the ability to walk away to do so with the interests of starting a business or becoming a business owner, whether or not you’re an active participant in it or not. So, all of that to say, if I had to boil it down to one thing, all of the above. We need government intervention, we need education, we need…

Kiersten Saunders: Income.

Julien Saunders: …culture, and social norms needs to be reevaluated so people feel a little bit more comfortable being or acting in a counterintuitive manner. All of the above is necessary.

Kiersten Saunders: And I just add on that we need role models. We need examples of people who have done the things right, whether it’s investing or saving heavily or retiring successfully. We need those stories. We need to update our examples of success for our community. We tend to highlight the extreme—the Oprah, the Obamas, the LeBrons. I was going to say the Joneses, but I don’t mean the ones that everybody compares them to. Just the regular Black Joneses. The Mitchells and the Saunders or whoever—these are people that you can admire as well and we need. We need refresh stories and those people to be celebrated just as much as we celebrate our celebrities.

Christine Benz: Julien, I want to follow up on the entrepreneurship point, because when you look at the data—and this cuts across racial lines—a lot of small businesses fail. People strike out and start businesses and they don’t succeed. So how do you talk to people about taking chances to pursue that entrepreneurial idea but also putting guardrails around it to ensure that it doesn’t completely blow up their whole financial plan?

Julien Saunders: That’s such a great question because it’s something that I do find when we talk about entrepreneurship with people. And what’s interesting is you use the term small business and that’s exactly the term that people use. But even when we’re talking about small business, I think people are thinking too big. You’re thinking about a multimillion dollar or even a million-dollar business or even a half-million-dollar business. You can be the worst photographer in the world and earn an extra $10,000 a year. Automate that to invest into an index fund and be a millionaire in 15 years. So those are the types of things that we’re talking about. So more specifically, it’s really just encouraging people to think smaller than a small business.

You should be thinking about micro enterprise, or you should be thinking about the power of self-employment—whatever language or word feels most comfortable—it’s really just about growing income and doing it in a way that is fruitful for you and comfortable for you. That doesn’t sacrifice your quality for life to some crazy extent, but that’s really what we actually encourage people to do, is to think smaller. I’m not asking you to create an app. I’m not asking you to break into tech or to have a brick and mortar. I’m simply asking you to think differently and to open yourself up to exceedingly wide number of ways to earn more income that exist today that didn’t exist even two years ago given the internet and social media. And so, again, it’s one of the reasons why we are so bullish on things like the creator economy. Because it is very lucrative and when done well can be a huge source of supplemental or even primary income for a great number of people.

Jeff Ptak: One topic we’ve discussed with other guests, including Michelle Singletary and Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, it’s what’s sometimes called the Black tax, which is a term that’s used to refer to the financial obligations that Black people often have to their family members and others in their community, and how that can affect their ability to get ahead. Can you talk about that issue and weigh in on whether that’s been a factor in your own journey?

Kiersten Saunders: It’s absolutely been a factor in our journey. It’s something that we’re dealing with now. It’s something that is much larger than the Black community as we enter into this crisis of shortage of healthcare professionals and just the care economy in general struggling after three years of the pandemic. I think the ways that people address this is very personal and it requires some internal work because it’s asking you to confront all of the cultural expectations and what you’ve been told to be true. What you’ve thought to be true for decades, it’s asking you to rethink the shape of your family and how that works. I know in our case we’ve decided to again subsidize Julien’s mom’s income. She lives off of Social Security, a very modest Social Security check. And that’s really it. She didn’t have additional retirement savings or a large portfolio to draw from. And so, for us, we’ve decided to supplement it because of the benefits that we get from having her close to us and our son. The generational wealth that we get from, not a monetary dollar, but just our son having access to elders and lots "

Jeff Ptak: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Jeff Ptak chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Christine Benz: And I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.

Ptak: Our guest on the podcast today is Sarah Newcomb, director of behavioral science at Morningstar. In her role she works to integrate the findings of her research into Morningstar financial management applications and tools. Before joining Morningstar in 2015, Sarah earned her doctorate in Behavioral Economics from the University of Maine, where her work focused on the psychological barriers to sound personal money management. She's the author of Loaded: Money, Psychology, and How to Get Ahead Without Leaving Your Values Behind. Sarah also holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Salem State University, a master's degree in Financial Economics from the University of Maine, and a master's certification in Personal Financial Planning from Bentley University.

Sarah, welcome to The Long View.

Sarah Newcomb: Thank you. It's great to be here.

Ptak: So maybe we'll start off with financial literacy, which I know is a key area of interest for you. You've noted that rules of thumb really work in financial education. What are some examples? And why are they so useful in your opinion?

Newcomb: I love rules of thumb. I think for the most part, we need to work with the way our brains work rather than against them. And we tend to take the complex and distill it down to the very simple, and so rules of thumb work with the way that our brains like to work.

One of my favorite examples of studies in the rules-of-thumb area was an experiment that was done with small business owners in, I believe it’s, Central America. And what they did was they split them into two groups, and one group was given a basic accounting course. And the second group was given just a bunch of rules of thumb for accounting. And then the next year, guess which group performed better on their accounting tasks? It was the rules of thumb group. And part of the reason is because rules of thumb are memorable, and they're general and flexible. And we can often take them into more than one circumstance. Where we learn exact equations, those equations only are fitting in very specific circumstances. And so, rules of thumb tend to be more general, more flexible, more memorable, and therefore they're more useful. So, I think that for most financial decisions, yes, there are some where exactitude is important, but most financial decisions can be solved with general rules of thumb as long as you're applying the right rule to the right circumstance.

Benz: What are some examples in personal finance where a rule of thumb might be useful?

Newcomb: I think some really simple ones are things that probably most people will be very familiar with: things like keeping your debt-to-income ratio below 30% so that you can get good interest rates and have your debt be manageable, and not overwhelming. Things like saving at least 10%. Putting general rules around the amounts that you're putting toward the past and the future, I think are really helpful. Things like, I mean, there's a typical ""100 minus your age"" for equity investment rule of thumb, which I think a lot of financial advisors balk at, but it's at least a starting point. It's at least a place to say, look, this is better than throwing a dart at the board. And lots of times what rules of thumb can do is get us started thinking about a problem and at least get us moving forward.

So, I think rules of thumb can be especially helpful in situations where there's a lot of information that's complex, and maybe not enough time to really digest all the information. Heuristics and rules of thumb are what our brains use to make good enough decisions, when we have constraints on our time, or the amount of information we have available to us or the amount of information we can process. And they're really applicable when you're in a situation where there's too much information or not enough time, or both. So especially when it comes to things like looking at comparing funds and comparing lots of complex attributes of different investment strategies to put into your portfolio.

A lot of times one of the things I love about Morningstar's work is our star ratings, our moat ratings, our globe ratings, our carbon leaf ratings--these are all rules of thumb. They take the very complex financial analysis and fundamental analysis of the company's balance sheet and business practices and distills them down to something that's digestible, memorable and useful. And so I think that those ratings are great rules of thumb to be able to say look in the absence of being able to understand every single bit of information and read all the prospectus on everything, you can say I'd like a fund that has five stars and a wide moat and five globes. And you're going to make a good enough decision in that situation. And we often focus on trying to make absolutely the optimal decision, when really what we need is to be able to make a good enough decision and be happy with that.

Ptak: That's a good segue to the next question we had, which is the financial-services industry and its tendency to try to optimize portfolios and financial decision-making, which is laudable in a way, but do you think it's gotten in the way of some of these rules of thumb taking hold? We're often surprised, for instance, about the amount of criticism that good quality target-date funds come in for among financial-services professionals, for example. So, do you think that the financial-services industry allows perfect to be the enemy of good, with good being some of those rules of thumb that you mentioned?

Newcomb: I really do. And I understand it as well. I'm a math person. I love numbers, I love the problem-solving, the puzzle aspect of trying to come up with an optimized investment strategy. And I know that because this involves math, a lot of us that are numbers-oriented want to be able to find that perfect solution. But there's a psychological reason why this optimization is actually not a great approach. And there's been some really interesting research into these different attitudes toward selection. And one of them is called maximizing, the ""maximizing mindset"" and the other one is called ""satisficing."" And what research has shown is that maximizing is all about trying to find the optimal choice, selecting the optimal choice for you. And we can do this in every domain of life from finding the perfect investment vehicle, or the perfect mate, the perfect restaurant, whatever it is, we try to optimize and maximize our well-being, maximize the utility that we're getting from something. Maximizing is looking for the best.

Satisficing is a totally different approach that sets sort of a standard, a bar above which, as long as the option that you're looking at meets or exceeds this particular standard that you set, you will be satisfied with the outcome. And what research has shown repeatedly is that people with a maximizing mindset often make an objectively better decision than the satisficers do. So, they do end up choosing the better option in the end. But when they're measured on satisfaction, on confidence in their choice, and on measures of things like depression, and overall well-being as related to the choice, maximizers are less happy with their choice than satisficers, even though they've objectively made a better choice. And part of the theory here is that what happens with a maximizing mindset is that you get so fixated on finding the perfect thing that you're never satisfied. Whereas if you have a satisficing mindset, the challenge is to set your standard of satisfaction high enough that you truly will be satisfied. And then beyond that, you stop searching for a better alternative.

So, I think to put this in a little bit more concrete terms, let's say you speculate on a company you think is really poised for growth, and you invest in that company. And it returns 400% return in the first year. Are you satisfied with a 400% return, or are you concerned with well, how high can it go? And a maximizing mindset won't be able to sell a winner, because you're fixated on getting the absolute most return you could possibly get. And so, you get fixated on timing the top. Where a satisficing mindset says, look a 400% return is a great return on my money. I'm going to take that and find another bargain somewhere.

Benz: I know that you're super-interested in the topic of financial education and helping people learn about investing in personal finance. I wanted to ask what you think about the stock market game that a lot of schools use to teach students about investing? Do you think that's productive? Or should they be doing something else to help kids get information and help them get engaged?

Newcomb: I have a lot of mixed feelings here. I know the people that run the stock market game, and I think that they are--it's a laudable effort, and I think there are some pros and some cons to it. The pros are that it definitely gets kids interested, and it makes the stock market feel accessible and fun to them. That's great. The cons are that when you think about it, the way the stock market game works is it's generally a one-yearlong competition and whoever gets the highest return wins. And so, what you're teaching them to do is to chase short-term returns. Because the team that wins is most likely--the best strategy for short-term returns is speculation, not long-term investment. You want to speculate and buy penny stocks and hope that you get a 5,000% return in that year. And you don't learn the benefits of long-term fundamental analysis when you are focused on chasing one-year returns.

It's difficult, though, to come up with a really strong alternative that's engaging enough, because with a 30-year timeline, the long-term investment takes a long time to see the payout. And it tends to be very boring in comparison. And I think the challenge for teaching kids or teaching anyone really about the stock market is to contract that 30-year timeline into something short-term so that you can get that adrenaline rush of the payoff without having to wait 30 years for it. But I think that the stock market game and getting kids involved in any kind of investment competition, where the metric of success is returns, and the time frame is short-term, you're setting them up to speculate, not to invest.

Ptak: So maybe to build on your answer there. How do you think do-it-yourself investors can balance their urge to dabble in individual stocks with the need to invest in a way that gets them to their goals? And how can advisors help their clients scratch that itch to pick stocks, while doing what's best for them? Is it reasonable, you think, to maintain sort of that separate ""mad money"" account?

Newcomb: I think it's a great question. Because the thing is that speculation is fun and legal and can be really lucrative. And it's one thing that really gets people involved in the stock market, is the idea that their money can grow quickly. So, I'm definitely pro speculation, I think speculation is great, so long as you play. The thing is that speculation and investment are two different games. And there's a different set of rules for each game. So, you need to know which game you're playing, and you need to do it responsibly. So long-term investment is slow and steady and fairly boring. And it's not going to give you that adrenaline rush. And many of us who like to see returns and who are impatient and want to see our money grow quickly, are more drawn to picking individual stocks, trying to find that way to get an edge on the market.

And I think having a separate mad money account, that's a reasonable percentage of your portfolio where you can afford to lose that money completely, and you're not going to be kicked off your trajectory toward long-term solvency then I think it's great. And if you make a lot of money speculating, then you've got more money to speculate with. But if you lose it, you're not losing sleep over it. And I think that having that percentage, having your fun money, I call it my gambling fund, it's a separate investment account that I've got set up for picking individual stocks. And it's great because I can scratch that itch. And I can get involved in investing in the things that I think are really exciting. But I'm never worried that I'm putting my financial future at risk by doing that. And if you're speculating with too large a portion of your assets, then you're going to be far more sensitive to the volatility of the stock market, because you're not as well diversified. I do think that it's great to let people play, but let them play with a responsible amount of money so that they're not sabotaging their long-term outcomes for short-term adrenaline.

Benz: Going back to the topic of financial education, we had Professor John Lynch on the podcast a while back, and he asserted that a lot of financial education doesn't stick and contribute to better outcomes because it decays over time, like a lot of education that we receive along the way. Does that jibe with your observation and what do we do with that? How do we change up what we're doing with financial education to address potential decay?

Newcomb: What I think Professor Lynch was referring to are the studies that show the memory decay of concepts after participating in certain financial literacy courses. And I've seen that research, too. And the thing about a lot of mathematical knowledge is like this; a lot of knowledge is sort of ""use it or lose it."" You can learn a topic, but if you're not actually putting it into practice, we don't remember facts unless they're repeated and repeated and repeated. And so, if you're not using it, then you're going to lose that knowledge. And the sort of use-it-or-lose-it nature of these topics make it very, very difficult to create really effective financial literacy programs.

I don't agree that financial literacy doesn't work, and I don't think that John was trying to say that it doesn't work as a blanket statement. But I do think that we have to pay attention to the teaching approaches and making sure that the ways that we are trying to communicate this information, let's use the knowledge that we have about what does work, and what we're seeing is sticking. And I think we've seen a lot of evidence that just-in-time financial education is really a lot more people are receptive to learning when there is something in their life, there is a financial decision that they're trying to make. For example, if you learn about a lot of different types of mortgages and interest-rate structures in high school, you may or may not remember that when you go to buy a house, depending on how interesting and engaged you were when you took the course. But when you're about to finance the largest, probably the largest purchase you've ever made, you're a lot more open to learning about the ins and outs of different mortgage products.

And so just-in-time financial education takes advantage of the emotional and psychological engagement of the moment and provides just the information that's needed at the right time to be able to then be put into practice right then. So that you do use it, and you're less likely to lose it, because you have put it into practice.

Ptak: As we've been talking about, it's hard not to be compelled by the just-in-time concept, but the question is how realistic it is to insert financial education into point-of-purchase decisions? 401(k) plans are maybe a best-case scenario where the employee generally wants, or I should say the employer generally wants what's best for the employee, but there's no such good actor in many other financial decision-making situations. So, can you think of practical ways that more just-in-time education can happen if it is feasible in some of those scenarios?

Newcomb: That's a really good point. And I think embedded in your question is the reality that we have this interesting situation where the financial services and advice industry is regulated under the caveat emptor framework, which is buyer beware. And so, the onus is on the customer to understand the products that they're buying. And how this sort of dovetails with just-in-time financial education is that people may not understand the math, or the pros and cons, or the different attributes, that are involved in the product-selection process when they're about to, say buy either a security or sign a loan product. In fact, a lot of people don't even think about these things as financial products. It's only in the finance industry that we use that term ""financial product."" Most people, most of the customers, aren't thinking about products like they're on a shelf and they can compare them by attribute.

What happens is that when people are ripe for learning about a particular financial decision, they will go and seek out information because the onus is on them to understand the products that they buy and the decisions that they make. And who's right there, really eager to give them all the information that they could want, so long as it's bent in their own version of things, is the sellers of those products. And so sometimes we end up with a situation where you have people who are very vulnerable to marketing and to misinformation, being the target of explanations, or basically marketing pitches that seem like they're financial education. So, there'll be workshops that try to teach you about retirement that really are trying to sell you a product. And because they do have some education embedded in them, they can be useful to some extent. But the customer is sort of an easy target for manipulation, because they don't know what they don't know.

And I do think that there are some ways we can get around this, I think that there are already some great solutions out there, some fintech firms that are trying to use things like alerts to monitoring transactions, monitoring things like your credit score. Credit Karma for instance, if they see a change in your credit score, they'll alert you to it. That's a great time to educate people about how to improve their credit score, or what kind of loan products they might qualify for, etc. So, in that case you're using the alert about a change in the person's either balance sheet or credit information to trigger that just-in-time moment for education. But even Credit Karma is trying to sell you credit cards or loan opportunities. You have to question whether the incentives are truly aligned.

I think that we could really, there's an opportunity here for better alignment between the people who have access to really holistic financial data about people, namely banks, who have all their transaction and balance information, and nonprofit financial literacy organizations. If we had some better alignment there, then maybe some of the people who are out there trying to teach sound financial literacy could have more of that, could find those moments through the banks being able to send an alert to someone if there is some behavioral or transactional data that alerts them to a critical moment that might be happening in a person's financial life. Could then surface the appropriate information and financial literacy information that they could use at that moment.

Again, even the banks tend to be commercial. So, we have an issue where there's often a misalignment between the interests of the seller and the interests of the buyer. And there's a huge asymmetry of information. And yet the onus of responsibility is on the buyer, who doesn't know what they don't know. I do think it's a big problem. I also think every problem is an opportunity. And there are ways that I think fintech can come in and be smart about what information they present to who and how. But I do think it's going to take a concerted effort on the part of commercial for-profit institutions that have that data, partnering with people who are trying to get the knowledge into the hands of the people that need it.

Benz: We want to switch over to discuss financial wellness and all that that encompasses. You've been working on a project that aims to help people quickly size up key metrics of their financial health. How are you aiming to get beyond the usual metrics like net worth statements when it comes to gauging financial wellness?

Newcomb: This project has been really a labor of love over the last year for me. I've been trying to figure out a good way to do personal financial statement analysis, much in the way that we look at financial statements of companies and look at things like their price/earnings ratio. I've been asking the question, ""What are some key ratios and statistics that we can glean from our personal balance sheets in order to find out how healthy our own financial management is?"" And I have some training in personal financial planning and went back to some of that information, the kinds of things that financial planners are trained in.

And generally what we do is we create a balance sheet and a cash flow statement and try to create something like a net worth goal over time, but I think there's so much more that we can look at to help us understand not just where we stand right now, but the trajectory of our wealth, the potential longevity of our wealth, measures of short- and long-term solvency. Some of the things that help us understand not just where we are, but how resilient we may be to shocks and losses. And putting these things into really simple metrics that are easy to calculate and easy to understand. So that we can set short- and long-term goals and track these things quickly over time.

And so, this has been a big project for me. And I've been thinking about it a lot, and most common is this net worth metric, but net worth is pretty meaningless on its own, I mean, what's $1 million? Well, if you spend $40,000 a year, then $1 million is a 25-to-1 ratio, which represents under pretty simple assumptions of inflation and growth expectations. A 25-to-1 ratio pretty much represents, you can retire, you're going to be financially independent, you're not going to outlive your money. But if you spend $200,000 a year, then that's only a 5-to-1 wealth-to-spend ratio, and that's only going to last you six or seven years under the same assumptions.

And so, being able to contextualize net worth into this ratio of wealth to spending is a really simple way to set a goal and say, look, I'm looking for a 15-to-1 ratio by the time I'm 60. Some people have already blown past that 20-to-1 ratio. And if you look at it that way, you might be able to say, well, if I have a 25-to-1 ratio, my wealth will last me 35 years on my current spending, just putting it into context. So that's one thing that I think is really helpful. Another one is looking at the trajectory of your balance sheet. And this is also fairly easy to calculate. What you do is you add up all the interest that you're paying on your debt--not the amount that you're paying down on your debt, just the interest that you're paying, just the money you're paying to own that debt in the first place. And you subtract that from the amount you expect your assets to grow over the next year.

Let's say you've got $100,000, growing at about 7% in a retirement account, so then you're looking at about $7,000 in interest on that account, in a year's time. But if you're paying $10,000 in interest on your debt, then you've actually got a $3,000 drag on your balance sheet because of the way that you've set up your accounts. And this concept of a base growth rate is another really simple statistic that you can calculate to find out before you add to your asset accounts. And before you pay down your debt, if you're just looking at the amount that your assets are earning in the accounts that they're currently in, invested as they are currently invested, and just the amount that you're spending on interest. Then, if you have a negative base growth rate, that's an immediate red flag that your debt needs attention. And so, before you go and invest more, you should probably either refinance some debt, or move some assets to pay down that debt, or somehow get that base growth rate to positive before you even start to add more to your assets and pay down your debt.

It's a way of finding out, is your balance sheet in balance? If you do nothing, is it going to grow, or shrink? And I think it's a really great way to look at that underlying health of your balance sheet. And it's two very simple numbers to calculate. And you subtract one from the other and you've got this very illuminating statistic. So those are the kinds of things that I've been scouring the Earth for, to try to find the things that we can use to illuminate our personal finance, so that we can see where we're at, see where we're going, and set some goals and track. If we track these simple metrics over time, we'll make better decisions than we would just by looking at our net worth.

Ptak: One challenge for everyone in the financial planning and investment space is getting people to prioritize the future. Are you compelled by research that shows getting people to empathize with their future selves works, for example, by showing them images of what they might look like later in life? Are there any tools that you could recommend in this vein?

Newcomb: Yes, so I have done a lot of research in this area and been inspired by some great academic researchers in this area, Hal Hershfield, Gabriel Edington, and some others. What I've seen in my own research is an extremely strong connection between how far into the future people tend to think and plan, and how much they have saved or acquired in assets. And when you think about it, it's kind of a no-brainer. If you want to be investing for the long term, you need to be able to think long-term. But we're not all naturally long-term thinkers. Some people are blessed with that as a trait, and they are naturally thinking 10, 20 years ahead, and those people are going to tend to be better planners and better savers than people like me who naturally think just a very short period of time ahead. And if you're only thinking a month into the future, what happens is that your discount rate--this has been connected in many studies, that people who are short-term thinkers have a higher discount rate--we have higher levels of present bias, which means that we are less likely to actually feel that we discount the cost. If we get the benefit today, then we overvalue the benefit in our mind's eye compared to the cost down the line, which we shrink in our mental estimation.

And when you do that mental cost-benefit analysis, the benefit of a small amount of money today feels a lot more than the benefit of a large amount of money in the future. Because the future is so far off in our mind's eye, that it's like a landscape painting, we shrink everything down. And we see it as small in comparison to this up-close benefit that we're getting right now. And that effect, we all have that effect in our brains to some extent. But people who are short-term thinkers, it's more pronounced, we have a higher discount rate. And for people who are naturally short-term thinkers, training our mind to think further ahead, training our brains to think further ahead and to see into the long view, can be an extremely valuable habit of mind to cultivate.

Now, naturally, long-term thinkers don't need to do this, because they're probably already doing it. But this is especially useful for people who are short-term thinkers. And most of the research that's been done in this space has been done on college students who are young, and the research shows that your mental time horizon does elongate naturally with age. We tend to think further ahead as we get older. But the problem is that by the time we're naturally thinking about retirement age, sometimes for those of us that weren't thinking far ahead in the future, it takes us too long. We're already in our late 30s or 40s by the time we're concerned about retirement, and at that point, it may be too late to catch up. And training your mind to think further ahead as soon as possible is an extremely efficient use of resources, because it doesn't cost anything. It's very simp"

Robby Greengold: Over the 10-year period ending September 2019, more than two of every three actively managed large-value funds failed to beat the total returns of the Russell 1000 Value Index. Mid-value funds fared even worse, with nearly nine out of 10 lagging their Morningstar Category index. Across the board, relative results for value funds have been disheartening for proponents of active management. The fierce competition for alpha begs the question, What flavors of value investing are out there, and what are the ingredients for success? Among value investors who take a fundamentals-based, bottom-up approach, a few distinct philosophies stand out. Some value investors focus on finding bargains, which they shop for through the lens of intrinsic valuation--they ask themselves, ""what's the worth of this company's assets today, on a per-share basis, and how does that compare to its stock price?""

The managers at Gold-rated AMG Yacktman are reliably valuation-conscious, which sometimes leads to hefty cash stakes when the team can't find cheap stocks to buy. Contrarian value investors look for stocks that are out-of-favor--companies that the market has punished for one misstep or another but that offer a better fundamental outlook than the market appreciates. The managers of Invesco Comstock, a Silver-rated large-value fund, often go against the grain. They conduct rigorous analysis of a company's financial statements and growth drivers, in addition to macro, industry, and idiosyncratic factors, all in order to gauge a stock's upside potential and downside risk. Weathering the storm of a controversial bet can take time to pay off, but the managers are patient as their investment theses play out. Other value investors prioritize quality over discounts. For example, Silver-rated MFS Value aims to emphasize companies with competitive advantages, solid balance sheets, and relatively high margins. That focus has contributed to the fund's historical resilience over the long run. For almost any fund that picks stocks using fundamental analysis, success relies heavily on the strength and stability of the team involved. Does the team stand out for its ability to construct a benchmark-beating portfolio that responsibly manages risk? For the three value-oriented funds we've discussed here, the answer is a resounding ""yes.""

Michael Hodel: For most of 2019, we've been recommending AT&T shares as the most attractive in the U.S. telecom industry, sporting a generous yield in addition to trading at a significant discount to our $37 fair value estimate. However, over the last several months, AT&T shares have rallied strongly, especially after Elliott Management started to take an interest in the company and push for changes in the management team and the corporate strategy.

With this stock now trading at a little bit of a premium to our fair value estimate, we don't see a ton in the U.S. telecom industry that's particularly attractive for dividend-seeking investors. Right now, if we were to pick one stock in the sector, we would look at Comcast. While Comcast shares don't yield as much as AT&T or even Verizon, they still yield about 2%. And importantly, the company doesn't pay out nearly as high a percentage of its free cash flow as AT&T or Verizon do. Comcast pays out about half as much as those two companies, roughly 25% to 30% of its free cash flow, and that gives the firm a lot more room to grow its dividend over time. So, while AT&T and Verizon have been growing their dividends about 2% annually, Comcast most recently raised its dividend 10%. And we think that dividend growth is set to continue over the next several years as Comcast digests the Sky acquisition, continues to repay debt, and continues to shift its focus more towards the dividend and away from share repurchases. And Comcast, we expect, will eventually return to share repurchases once it gets its leverage down to a more comfortable range. But we do think that that dividend will make up a more important portion of the firm's total capital return over time.

And with regard to the balance sheet, Comcast and AT&T have similar leverage. So, Comcast after the Sky acquisition has about 3 times debt to EBITDA, which is a little bit higher than where AT&T is at, at about 2.7 times, but AT&T also has its pension obligations that aren't factored into that metric. So, on an apples-to-apples basis, the balance sheets between Comcast and AT&T are roughly comparable. And so, we think Comcast has equal if not a little bit better credit profile than AT&T does.

So, Comcast isn't a compelling bargain today. It trades right in line with our $45 fair value estimate. But relative to AT&T and Verizon, which again are trading at premiums to our fair value estimates, we view Comcast as somewhat more attractive today.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar. Many retirees are terrified of running out of money in retirement, but they need to balance that worry against a competing consideration: underspending and not enjoying their retirements to the fullest. Joining me to share some thoughts on how retirees can strike the right balance is Joel Dickson. He's Vanguard's global head of advice methodology.

Joel, thank you so much for being here.

Joel Dickson: Great being here, Christine. Thank you.

Benz: Joel, when I heard we were sitting down, I wanted to discuss something with you that came up when you taped our podcast, our Morningstar podcast. And we were discussing this whole thing about retirement plans, sustainability, and people like you and me think a lot about how can we make sure this person doesn't run out of money. But you raised a really provocative point, which is that it's a big deal if someone way underspends during their spending horizon. So, let's talk about why you think that issue is under discussed.

Dickson: I do think there's been so much focus on the worry about not having enough resources during your accumulation years to then be able to meet a retirement approach, a retirement spending approach. And a lot of times, it's like, the headlines about people aren't ready for retirement, they're not going to be able to spend how they want, maintain their standard of living. And in many ways, I think that's overblown. Not to mean it isn't important! People need to think about, you know, what do I need for retirement. But where I look at it is that we have kind of the standard assumptions for how we define success and whether you will have sufficient resources to meet your retirement needs. And I think it's really important to look and understand what those assumptions are. And a big one in retirement is, the standard approach in advising around success and retirement: retire at age 65, plan for a 30 year or more retirement.

Benz: Right.

Dickson: And success is basically,do I run out of money by the time of the end of that planning horizon? So, for 100% of people, we are using a planning horizon of let's say, age 95 or age 100 to which less than 5% of people will probably actually survive--at least under current mortality assumptions. So that 5% case is extraordinarily, in some ways, conservative. Now, there will be people that make that…

Benz: Right.

Dickson: …that far and we need to worry about.

Benz: Right. Plus, there's a real connection with wealth and longevity, right?

Dickson: There is.

Benz: So, people watching us probably, I'm guessing have portfolios, they are wealthier individuals, they may be a little closer toward that 30 year time horizon.

Dickson: Yes, very much so, but at the same time, even to the extent let's even say it's 10% of people that make it that long. In many ways, you're going to have not so much of retirement savings crisis, but a retirement spending piece of, there's going to be money left over. Not a bad thing necessarily, but you know, it's more of, could you have enjoyed that during your lifetime, in a different way? And I think it gets back to working with your advisor or talking with yourself, your partner, and so forth about what does success look like in retirement? What is it that I want to accomplish and achieve? Because what I call the ""bounce my check at the funeral"" approach, which is, hey, do I run out of money by the time I'm age 95 or 100? And I'm just going to spend to that piece, right? Actually, it doesn't reflect how people have generally, at least how we've seen people spend money in retirement.

Benz: OK, so have that discussion about whether a bequest is a big deal to you. If it's not, then you may want to spend a little more actively from the portfolio, or how should you approach that?

Dickson: I think especially in the early years of retirement, those are the years that most people can enjoy the spending. There's often another part of the assumption in the whole planning process of, I have this 85% number of my final income, that I'm trying to target. And it's going to grow with inflation. You know, in terms of what I'm spending in retirement. What we see in terms of actual spending, all those things like healthcare spending, tends to increase over the retirement period. Overall spending tends to decline in inflation-adjusted terms. So, what we end up seeing is actually--and in part, my 80-year old parents are very much in this situation right now--it's not that they don't necessarily want to spend, but they don't really have the ability to spend on things, like they just can't go on trips in the same way they did or come visit the grandchildren in the same way that they did. And so those types of physical, mental limitations and so forth as we get older. One question is whether that spending can be shifted a little bit early. So maybe you spend a little bit more in early retirement years when you may be more able to do that, recognizing that your spending will probably adjust automatically or you may adjust it based on resources as well later in retirement.

Benz: Right. So one other complicating factor--and we could talk about this all day--if the market is not so great in your early retirement years, when you were hoping to really do a lot of your spending, that can be a problem, especially if you are needing to spend from an equity portfolio that's declining.

Dickson: Yeah. It's interesting because, this whole sequence of returns question, which is that point: Does it matter when the returns of the market happen in terms of your own retirement journey? I actually still see that as a longevity question not so much as a market question, which is that sequence of return only matters if you live a long time. If you only end up living to 85, then the sequence of returns if you have otherwise been said to be sufficient to age 95 or 100, the fact that you live to 85, probably that sequence of returns isn't as important. So, it's ultimately a longevity thing. And can you think about ways to protect against that longevity risk while still spending from your portfolio in a way that just doesn't say, I'm going to forgo spending now because I'm worried about potentially running out of money later.

And that's why things like, think about, we talk in a kind of a Vanguard global retirement framework standpoint, about different buckets of money--not buckets in the ways the same way, Christine, that you talk about it for investing. But in terms of things like your basic level of income or discretionary income or spending. We kind of bucket that all together when we talk about, oh, you have an 85% chance of not outliving your resources. But probably what most people want is 100% chance or as close as possible to being able to meet the basic everyday living expenses. Yeah, I've got some sort of roof over my head, I've got the food, I've got my basic medical needs taken care of.

Benz: Don't have to move in with the kids.

Dickson: Exactly. It's the ""don't be a burden,"" sort of, ""I don't want to be a burden to someone else"" piece. If the discretionary pieces now, on top of that, it's like, well, yeah, OK, I'd love to do it. But if I can't, I'm still not being a burden. That piece of it I think, thinking about it from that standpoint and focusing on what's the basic level of income that I really need to insure against, and that's being the first piece. And that may be covered by Social Security, it may be covered by you having defined-benefit income, you might even early in your years work part-time. There are any number of ways.

Benz: Use an annuity perhaps in that context.

Dickson: Use an annuity, exactly. Potentially also long-term care insurance in retirement to, I guess, again, managing some downside risks, although that market is complex and probably needs some guidance...

Benz: Right.

Dickson: ...In looking at that. But there are a number of things that, if we focus on what's the kind of basic level of income, that then frees up, kind of the flexibility in the discussion for other sources of income and how you then think about enjoying that, and maybe you can even then front-load some of that early in the retirement years.

Benz: OK, Joel, great insights. Always great to hear your perspective. Thank you so much for being here.

Dickson: Thank you, Christine.

Benz: Thanks for watching. I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.

Charles Gross: Narrow-moat Sherwin-Williams is among the largest producers of architectural and industrial paint in the world. We assign a $340 per share fair value, well below the prevailing market price of $590. With shares trading well into 1-star territory, we strongly recommend clients avoid purchasing shares, or divest their current holdings.

The market price currently bakes in two key assumptions that we disagree with. The first is that Sherwin-Williams will gain unrealistic amounts of market share over the coming decade. The second is that the company will achieve record-breaking adjusted EBITDA margins and sustain them over the economic cycle. Both outcomes appear highly unlikely to play out.

Digging into the first argument--Sherwin-Williams grows its share of the coatings market by opening new stores. Over the last two decades, the company has been able to grow its footprint by about 2% to 2.5% annually. In order for us to generate a fair value comparable with the current market price, we have to assume that the company can accelerate that opening pace to 3.5% per year--more than 200 new stores each year--into an increasingly saturated market for paint. The constraints that will prevent the company from reaching those expectations come down to labor constraints and only so many attractive new storefront locations. Management has already noted how challenging it is to maintain current growth rates of new store growth, let alone opening twice as many stores going forward.

On margins, today's market price implies substantial profit gains on both the retail and industrial side of Sherwin's business. On the retail side, Sherwin would need to achieve and maintain EBITDA margins of 27%--that's not only well above the best-ever performance Sherwin has generated, but it's well above the best performance we've seen in the entire industry over the last 20 years. On the industrial side of the business, the company would need to maintain EBITDA margins consistent with the highest levels seen across the industry since 1999 indefinitely. We think neither outcome is realistic.

We think future energy or pigment price shocks will be enough to shake Sherwin's share price back to earth. About half of each can of paint is linked to energy prices. Even though paint companies are often thought of as industrial businesses, their margins are clearly correlated with changing input prices. The company benefited significantly from the energy price collapse in 2014 and 2015, which we think is part of why investors are so optimistic about future margin levels. Even in the absence of an input price shock, we think competition over market share will be enough to prevent record-high margins from lasting indefinitely.

Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I'm Susan Dziubinski. Morningstar director of personal finance Christine Benz just put the finishing touches on the content of our annual Portfolio Makeover Week. Christine is here to share some of the key lessons from the week that we can all learn from.

Christine, thanks for joining us today.

Christine Benz: Susan, it's my pleasure.

Dziubinski: Now your first lesson is for people to think about getting help planning for their retirement. Do we all need financial advisors?

Benz: Well, possibly. One thing I would say is when I looked through the submissions, and we got a lot this year, many of them were from people who were just getting ready to retire. So, they're trying to figure out, do I have enough? If when I embark upon retirement, I'm looking at my portfolio, how much can I withdraw from it each year? Really hard questions. And I do think that because retirement decumulation is inherently more complicated than accumulating assets for retirement, it is a good spot to stop and get some help.

What I would say though, Susan, is that not everyone needs ongoing portfolio handholding. So don't assume that if you have an advisor who you're using to help with your retirement plan that you necessarily need to sign on for an ongoing engagement. You might just get maybe a one-time check on your plan, and then maybe checks every couple of years, as you go along. You might not need that ongoing handholding. So, I leave it to each of our viewers to decide how much help they need. But it's definitely helpful, especially at this life stage to seek out the help of a tax-savvy financial advisor.

Dziubinski: Now, you noticed that a number of people who had submitted portfolios said that they were planning to delay their retirement, which--there's nothing wrong with that. But you suggest that people have a backup plan. Why is that?

Benz: Well, I love to hear that. And I will say, for example, one of the couples who I profiled, he was 80, she was 70. They had really enjoyed working, they work together actually, and they were just now getting fully retired. So, we're seeing this more and more I think in our lives, too. And there's a lot to be said from the standpoint of finances when it comes to delaying retirement. The thing I come back to, though, is what Mark Miller says, Morningstar contributor Mark Miller says, which is that delaying retirement is a worthy aspiration, but it's not a plan.

And to sort of accentuate that fact, I would point to some research from our colleague David Blanchett, who's Morningstar Investment Management's head of Retirement Research. And David's research has shown that people oftentimes don't retire at the point in their lives when they expected to. So oftentimes, people who expected to delay are forced to retire earlier than they expected. It might be their own health considerations. It might be spouse’s or parents’ health considerations. It might be that they were maybe forced out of that higher-paying job sooner than they expected to. So, I think it's always worthwhile to lay a backup plan. If your plan is to extend out your working years, put in place a plan for what you would do in case you couldn't keep working.

Dziubinski: Now, Portfolio Makeover Week is usually about, sort of the investments in the portfolio. But you can't deny the importance of Social Security and sort of the equation of retirees. So, can you talk a little bit about how impactful delaying Social Security can be, and what you found with the makeovers.

Benz: It's huge. And so, you know, we'll run through sort of various scenarios using portfolios with different asset allocations, and different withdrawal rates, and changes that we can make at the portfolio level. But some of the changes that you can make with Social Security delay date, if you're willing to extend that a little bit can be just so much more impactful. So, an example I would give from the Portfolio Makeover Week is that one of the people was a 60-year-old woman, and she was sort of toying with retiring at full retirement age claiming Social Security benefits at what Social Security calls her full retirement age. So, like 67 versus waiting all the way until age 70. And what she found was that the differential was like between $2,500 a month and $3,200 a month, so a $700 a month differential for delaying. And it's just impossible to make that kind of gain in a portfolio value with changes.

Dziubinski: With some tweaks.

Benz: Right, right. So, it's just one of the biggest-ticket changes that you can make to a plan. The thing I would say is that delaying Social Security doesn't necessarily mean delaying retirement. So, it may be that someone retires, pulls from their say, Traditional IRA assets first, and then delays Social Security and is able to claim that benefit later. So, there are a lot of moving parts here. But it doesn't necessarily mean that delaying Social Security means a later retirement date, part-time work can also figure into the mix.

Dziubinski: Now, it always pays to be sober about market return expectations. But you noted in the in the makeovers that that's especially true for pre-retirees and retirees. Why is it so important for that cohort?

Benz: Well, because that the first say 10 years of retirement is a really important time in retirement, and you want to make sure that you're not drawing too much from your portfolio, or expecting too much from your portfolio during those early years. So, when I was plugging in return assumptions for people who are getting ready to retire, I was using very muted return expectations, in part because of the current market environment that we're in. So, we have very low bond yields, currently. We have not-cheap equity valuations, although I've been singing that same song for a couple of years now, and things really haven't changed, things have continued to be really quite good. But nonetheless, I think it is probably just prudent when you're thinking about the next 10 years to be mindful that market returns might not be that great. You definitely don't want to extrapolate from the past 10 years for the next 10, because we rarely see things work out that way.

What I would say, though, Susan, for folks who have longer time horizons who aren't so concerned about near-term retirement, but maybe they're planning to retire in 50 years or 40 years, or something like that, well there I say if you have an equity-heavy portfolio, go ahead and use long-term market return assumptions, maybe 8% or so for the equity market. Because I do think over long periods of time, it's the best we have to go on. And you probably don't want to give your return expectation that much of a haircut if you have a really long time horizon.

Dziubinski: And speaking of people, investors who have longer time horizons, you had a few makeovers this past week that focused on older folks who are either entering retirement or nearing retirement, but you did have a couple of younger portfolio makeovers this year. And for those, there's an emphasis on remembering to balance the short term and the long term. Can you talk a little bit about that?

Benz: Yeah, it's really interesting to me. One was a younger individual not yet married, the other was married couple, three young children. And so what really struck me in looking at their plans was, yes, they needed to prioritize retirement funding because they can take advantage of compounding, all those things we hear about, the advantage of getting started early on your retirement fund. But they were also balancing here-and-now considerations and in both of their cases, what I saw is, in my view, they're pretty underfunded in terms of their emergency fund. So, I think a little multitasking is in order. Both were trying to purchase homes in fairly high, expensive property markets. So that was another challenge.

So, one thing that I would say is kind of a tip for people who are trying to balance the long term and the short term, is to think about using a Roth IRA for part of the plan. And one reason that I have always talked about the Roth IRA being such a nice multitasking vehicle, is that you can withdraw your contributions at any time and for any reason without taxes or penalty. So even if your intention is to leave the money to grow until retirement, if you need to get at it sooner, you can get in there without many strings attached. So, I think that's a nice vehicle to consider maybe in addition to taxable accounts that you might have for emergency fund needs.

Dziubinski: Great. Well, Christine, thank you for sharing these lessons today and thank you for the makeovers this week.

Benz: Thank you, Susan.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz from Morningstar.com. Morningstar's director of manager research, Russ Kinnel, is a long-time observer and researcher of mutual funds. He's here with me today to share some of the holdings in his own portfolio.

Russ, thank you so much for being here.

Russ Kinnel: Glad to be here.

Benz: Russ, I feel a little like I am getting a look at what's in Bobby Flay's cupboard or something like that. It's great that you are willing to share some of your own personal portfolio holdings. Before we get into them I'd like to talk about what qualities generally speaking you look for when selecting mutual funds.

Kinnel: I look for low cost, great management, great strategy, ideally something that can be a core holding for a long time in my portfolio. Really a lot of the things we look for in a Gold-rated fund are what I look for. To be a top holding in my portfolio naturally has to be something you can really depend on, something I really have a high opinion of.

Benz: Where do you come down on the passively managed versus actively managed question when it comes to your own portfolio?

Kinnel: I think they are both great. I have mostly active funds in my portfolio, but I do have some passive as we'll discuss. I think they are both great. We have Gold-rated funds from both categories. I think most people should probably own some of each, I think it just makes a lot of sense--each can do a good job and it also depends, how much effort you want to put into the research obviously. Active requires a little more effort than the passive.

Benz: Good point. Before we get into some of your specific holdings, for each of them I am hoping you can say where you hold them--whether you hold them in 401(k), IRA, taxable account, or so forth. Let's start with American Funds New World. Talk about where you hold it and then I'd like to get into why you like it.

Kinnel: I have got this one in my 401(k), it's in Morningstar's 401(k). I just like the fact that it's a nice conservative emerging-markets fund. We have institutional share class of the fund, so very low cost, very dependable fund.

Benz: For people who aren't familiar with this particular fund. It's really different from most other pure emerging-markets equity funds. Let's talk about that and how it's construction sets it apart and makes it more conservative.

Kinnel: That's right. It's got some of your typical emerging-markets equities. But it also has some in developed market equities from businesses that do a lot of business in emerging markets. It's kind of taking a more holistic approach to that, and what that means is that it's less volatile, but it also means you are giving up a little. When emerging markets really rally this fund's going to lag. I think it makes a lot of sense, that there are a lot of different ways to get that exposure. To me, it makes a lot of sense, but it's not going to be the highest potential returner in the EM space.

Benz: Right. So, in a year like 2017 when EM is going strong this fund will perhaps tend to not perform quite as well.

Kinnel: That's right, but I think its useful for investors because these more cautious EM funds are the kind that people will hold through the downturn, because when emerging markets get hit they get hit really hard. You lose 50% or 60% of your investment. If you can minimize that loss or reduce it a bit that's going to help people stick through to the good side.

Benz: Really good point. Let's look at another international fund, this is Dodge & Cox International Stock. Let's talk about where you own it first and why you own it.

Kinnel: Sure. I have got this one actually in my 401(k) and in a taxable account. I initially brought in a taxable account before it was available in our 401(k), later added it to our 401(k), so I own it in both places.

Benz: In terms of it's appeal it lands in our foreign large blend category it's a Gold-rated fund. Really time-tested process on display in this fund.

Kinnel: Dodge & Cox is an old school value investing firm. But to me maybe the most important thing is just the stability of people, that their analysts and managers tend to make a career of it there. You've got team-managed approach here, and so one person, retiring doesn't throw off the fund in the least. Really a great group of analysts and managers there. When I talk about a fund you can own and forget about, Dodge & Cox is really almost like an index fund in that you can buy their funds and they are pretty much going to be the same fund in five or 10 years.

Now this one does obviously have some risks. It got burned in '08, it had too much in financials, but I really believe in the fund, obviously, I owned it before that time and I held through. So, I am a true believer.

Benz: Dodge & Cox funds are really low cost.

Kinnel: Very low cost. Again, we talk about active versus passive, and I think whether you are active or passive, you want low costs. When you have a low-cost active fund like this one, they only have a small hurdle to catch up with a passive fund.

Benz: Now, let's look at another fund that you hold. This is Vanguard Primecap Core. Let's talk about where you hold it and why you like it. By the way, this is one I own, too.

Kinnel: This one is closed to new investors. I hold it in a taxable account. There are Primecap Odyssey funds that are still open, so you can get pretty similar fund. But low cost, the best growth investors out there. I just really believe in them. You have a team approach here where each manager picks stocks separately from the other managers, but they all have the same input of their analysts. They are just very good fundamental growth investors. You put that together with Vanguard, and its really low cost. This one I have in a taxable account. I have Vanguard Capital Opportunity in an IRA, and I have Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth in a 401(k). So, I am a big fan.

Benz: It is one of the firms, when we ask our analysts, what's your highest conviction active shop, Primecap usually bubbles close to the top.

Kinnel: They are outstanding.

Benz: Let's talk about the last fund, also a Vanguard fund, this is Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation. Based on its name, I'm assuming you hold it in a taxable account, you better.

Kinnel: Good guess.

Benz: Let's talk about that. I think that these tax-managed funds, you and I both like them, but they are kind of under-recognized among investors, especially as many investors have gravitated toward ETFs for tax efficiency. Tax-managed funds, though, are still worth a look.

Kinnel: Yeah, they are. Jack Bogle once joked about the words ""tax managed"" being the best way to scare investors away, and it seems to continue to work. You put ""tax"" in the name and people think it's boring, you are sacrificing returns. It's really just essentially the Russell 1000 with a couple of tilts. One, they tilted slightly away from dividend payers, because dividends sometimes get taxed more than capital appreciation. The other thing is they actively harvest losses in order to offset gains. The upshot is on an aftertax basis you should do really well, and in fact it has done really well. It's actually beaten the Russell 1000, the S&P 500 on a pretax basis. I don't know that I would necessarily that going forward. That may just be a little bit of luck. But the more important thing is on a aftertax basis, this fund should continue to deliver. It really is good at avoiding capital gains distributions.

Benz: It gives you very broad diversification almost indexlike exposure but with a little bit more tightness around the tax efficiency.

Kinnel: That's right, and it's super cheap and of course when these funds came out there were not many ETFs out there. Now it's maybe less of a standalone draw compared with ETFs because now there is lots of ETFs with good tax advantages. But it still keeps on chugging, it's really low cost, and it does a great job.

Benz: The other thing that I like about it is that it can adjust to the tax regime. If tax laws change, and as you suggested dividends could be at some point taxable as ordinary income again, the fund would be able to adjust its strategy a little bit.

Kinnel: That's right. Because it's not actually an index fund, it's passive more or less, it does have some flexibility to adjust that. It is nice because the tax laws change every few years.

Benz: Russ, thank you so much for giving us a peek into your own portfolio, really helpful.

Kinnel: You are welcome.

Benz: Thanks for watching. I'm Christine Benz from Morningstar.com.

Heineken is the only truly global premium lager brand, and we see the firm as well-positioned to exploit the long-term trend of consumers demanding higher-quality alcoholic beverages.

At 8% global market share by volume, Heineken is a distant second behind Anheuser-Busch InBev, which controls more than one fourth of the market. But those volume figures don't tell the whole story. Heineken's consumers have higher incomes than drinkers of mainstream beer categories, where AB InBev dominates.

Demand for premium beer is also less subject to cyclical macroeconomic forces, and consumers are somewhat less price-sensitive. As a result, brand loyalty is a more significant source of economic moat for Heineken than it is for the other leading brewers.

Heineken's narrow economic moat is also supported by its cost advantage over smaller competitors. Heineken is the number-one or -two brewer in the majority of its large geographies and is the global leader in cider. This market leadership gives the firm a cost advantage, since brewing is a capital-intensive process that requires large investments in plant and equipment.

We expect Heineken's competitive positioning to strengthen over time and for the company to deliver long-term improvements to returns on capital. We therefore assign the firm a positive moat trend rating.

Our fair value estimate for Heineken's ADRs is $52 and shares are fairly valued today. At a wider margin of safety, though, Heineken is a solid investment opportunity.

***

Jaime Katz: Narrow moat Tractor Supply continues to trade a compelling discount to our $84 fair value, in 4-star territory. The company released solid first-quarter results despite a spring that has yet to arrive across many of its geographies, capitalizing on an increasingly nimble supply chain to keep cold-weather gear in the network where appropriate. Moreover, this implies that spring sales remain postponed in many areas, potentially leading to a warm-weather season that is compressed into the second quarter and comps that could be around 3%, similar to first-quarter comp store sales of 3.7%. The first quarter was the third sequential quarter of same-store sales growth above 3%, a key level where Tractor Supply can leverage expenses, although we caution investors that the rest of the year is forecast to deliver comps below this quarter's metric.

While some of the categories that Tractor Supply operates in are relatively mature, we view the breadth of its offerings and potential for growth of its current consumer base, as well as increased penetration of new consumers, as positive factors that could drive top-line growth. We project that total sales can grow at 7% over the next five years supported by low-single-digit comparable-store sales and mid-single-digit square footage growth. On the cost side, our assumptions incorporate modest margin expansion of about 20 basis points annually on average after 2018 leading to an operating margin of 9.4% in 2021. Besides lower costs attributable to opening new distribution and third-party logistics facilities ahead, Tractor Supply should be able to tactically allocate its advertising spend, drawing on information from the 7.6 million members in the Neighbor's Club loyalty program the company launched nationally just one year ago.

For investors seeking exposure to the consumer discretionary industry, we think Tractor Supply remains one of the best-positioned brick-and-mortar retailers in operation, thanks to its differentiated product mix, loyal customer base, and defensibility against e-commerce competitors, thanks to the high weight/value proposition of their products.

Billy Fitzsimmons: We recently re-evaluated our entire cybersecurity coverage list. And in doing so, we took a fresh look at Palo Alto Networks. We still maintained the no-moat rating, but we upgraded the trend to positive from stable. Overall, we think there's two major trends affecting cybersecurity vendors like Palo Alto Networks. First, complexity and second, consolidation.

It used to be that network security vendors were creating firewall services whether physical or virtual. Today, the vectors of attack for enterprises is becoming much more complex. You have firewall, you have SaaS, you have endpoint security, cloud security. They are making the enterprise security efforts much more byzantine. You need multiple solutions to protect yourself from all those vectors.

Second is consolidation. It used to be that a point vendor would sell you the services for endpoint which would be separate from firewall. Now we're seeing consolidation where one vendor like Palo Alto can do all those things together. We think that's increasing the switching costs for a company like Palo Alto Networks. We have solid uptick in new products such as WildFire, sandboxing operation, and we are also seeing growth in nascent products such as VM-Series and Aperture, which are poised to grow.

We think overall instead of just selling the next-generation firewall, which is Palo Alto's bread and butter, customers are going to increasingly buy subscription offerings from them, which is going to keep growing average revenue per user, which has been ticking upward the past five years. We think this is poised to continue and as enterprises purchase more and more solutions from Palo Alto Networks, it engrains Palo Alto's services inside the IT infrastructure of its client base, growing switching costs.

Now, having said that, our $182 fair value estimate places Palo Alto Networks in fairly valued territory. For investors looking to get into this space, we'd recommend a look at Check Point Software Technologies, which we believe is trading at a discount. It's poised to grow at a slower rate than Palo Alto, but we like the firm's 50% operating margins, $4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and strong management team that we think is poised to continue to buying back shares over the ensuing years.

Jeremy Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. It's graduation season, and many people might think a check to the new grad is the best gift. Christine Benz, our director of personal finance, thinks that there's some more nuance there and some other choices that you have.

Christine, thanks for joining me.

Christine Benz: Jeremy, great to be here.

Glaser: You think that when thinking about gift giving to new grads, you really do have to consider their life stage and that cash may not always be the best choice?

Benz: That's right. For people exiting high school, oftentimes college is on their radar, so some sort of dedicated college savings vehicle might make sense. If it's someone who is exiting college, maybe they have higher education or further education on their radar, maybe additional savings for that educational expense makes sense. For people who are exiting college and beginning new jobs, you may have some other investment types that you want to help contribute to on their behalf.

Glaser: Looking at high school grads, or someone who has grad school on their future, are 529s really the best vehicle?

Benz: Well, certainly, when it comes to the tax benefits, 529s are hard to beat. As long as the money stays within the confines of the 529 plan, assets can be invested and grow without any tax burden. Then when you pull the money out for college expenses, for qualified college expenses, those withdrawals will also be tax-free. Another key advantage is that if you contribute to your home state's 529 plan or whatever plan you contribute to offers tax deductions or credits, that also burnishes the appeal of 529 plans from a tax standpoint.

Glaser: One downside though can be how it impacts your financial aid?

Benz: That's right. It does depend mainly on your relationship to the student. If you are a parent, the 529 assets tend not to be particularly punitive from the standpoint of that FAFSA form, that financial aid form. But if you are a nonparent, say, you are a grandparent or an uncle who wants to contribute to educational expenses, those assets will tend to affect the child's financial aid eligibility if they are spent prior to the child's final year of college. That's one reason why college funding experts say, if you are a nonparent, advise the parents to hang on to those assets until that last year of school, so it won't affect financial aid eligibility.

Glaser: Writing a check or giving cash also is going to impact financial aid too?

Benz: Well, it could. Large cash gifts to a student will potentially affect their financial aid eligibility; so will saving for the student within the confines of a UGMA/UTMA account, because those assets are technically the property of the child. That tends to look the worst from the standpoint of the financial aid applications. The other thing to know about the UGMA/UTMA accounts is that those assets become the property of the child when he or she reaches the age of majority. The child does not bound to use those assets for college funding. If that's your goal, you may want to get the money inside some sort of college savings wrapper.

Glaser: Let's talk about investing in these 529 plans. Sometimes the time horizon is quite short. For a high school student, it could just be a couple of years. What's the right asset mix that's going to make sense?

Benz: It's a really good question. Certainly, if you have a time horizon of, say, shorter than five years, you should not be in stocks with that component of the 529 plan. You'd want to focus on high-quality bonds, ideally short-term bonds, perhaps even cash investments for very near-term expenditures. Some 529 plans have stable-value funds. Those can be a nice option that offer you a little bit higher yield than cash, perhaps a little bit more risk, but not much more so. That's another vehicle type to investigate.

Glaser: Turning to the grad who doesn't have school in their future again, what are some of the options there that could get them off on the right foot?

Benz: There are a couple of things to think about. One is, if the student has some sort of student loan that he or she is exiting college with, perhaps you can lend a helping hand in terms of paying down that debt. The typical student exits college with about $30,000 in college expenses or in college loans. Many students have much more than that. If you can help burn through some of that debt, I think that that's a really gracious, terrific thing to do.

Another idea is, if you have someone in your life who is just exiting college, maybe getting an apartment, getting that first lob, maybe you can just give a baseline of cash and counsel about the virtue of having that emerging cushion. Say, this is not money that I intend for you to use to take great trips or buy a car. This is money that you are going to use to hold as an emergency fund to help defray any unanticipated costs. You can do a little bit educating along the way.

Finally, for young people who are exiting college and who have landed jobs, one other idea is to consider contributing to a Roth IRA on his or her behalf. The big advantage is that that young person can take advantage of his or her very long runway to grow those assets for retirement. Of course, there are really valuable tax benefits that accompany a Roth IRA. The other thing I like about the Roth IRA as kind of starter savings vehicles is that it can multitask for emergency fund needs and for long-term retirement funding. If you pull your contributions out of a Roth IRA, there will be no taxes or penalties, which makes it a nice, kind of, retirement savings vehicles with training wheels for people who are trying serve multiple goals.

Glaser: The question I know you get a lot is about the gift tax and people being worried about the gift tax. You think a lot of these worries are overblown?

Benz: I do. If you contribute or if you give more than $15,000 to a single individual in a single year, so in 2018, you will have to file a form to accompany your tax return. But unless your total lifetime gifts combined with your estate after your death exceed $11 million, you will not be subject to actual gift tax. You won't have to pay extra taxes for having been generous during your lifetime. I do think that sometimes people hear about that gift tax form and think that it necessarily entails paying extra tax; in most cases, it doesn't.

Glaser: Christine, thanks for your gift giving tips today.

Benz: Thank you, Jeremy.

Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. Thanks for watching.

Disney shares were modestly lower this morning despite the firm turning in better than expected quarterly results. With the stock trading in the 4-star range, we believe current prices offer an attractive entry point for investors.

While management did not discuss the potential for a spoiler bid from Comcast for either the Fox assets or Sky, CEO Bob Iger reiterated the importance of the assets and the firm's desire to buy both the Fox media assets and Sky.

Overall revenue for the quarter increased 9% year over year to $14.5 billion. The studio segment continues to outperform as Black Panther has grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide and ""Avengers: Infinity War"" has already exceeded $1.2 billion in global box office without opening in China.

Andrew Lane: Within the Morningstar equity research department, we keep a close eye on the performance of the Wide Moat Focus Index, a collection of the cheapest U.S. wide-moat-rated stocks under our coverage. Typically, the strategy holds 40 to 50 stocks, with the reconstitution and rebalancing process taking place four times per year. The index is important to us as its construction represents the cross section of our differentiated economic moat methodology and our rigorous bottom-up valuation work.

In the first quarter of 2018, the strategy underperformed its Morningstar U.S. market benchmark by 1.6 percentage points. This represents a pause from the strong momentum established over the last two years. In 2017, the Wide Moat Focus Index outperformed its benchmark by 2.3 percentage points and in 2016 the strategy outperformed its benchmark by 10 percentage points.

In the first quarter, index performance benefited from a positive allocation effect, driven primarily by an overweight position in the consumer cyclical sector. However, unfavorable stock selection more than offset sector positioning tailwinds. From a stock selection standpoint, the index saw impressive first-quarter performance from technology holdings but disappointing performance from healthcare and consumer cyclical stocks. Veeva Systems, Amazon, and Salesforce stood out as top contributors to index performance in the quarter.
