Bellow you will be provided with a financial hack description. According to this weighting criteria classify and score the financial advice based on its usefulness, complexity, and uniqueness.

## Criteria for Weighting:

- Usefulness: How actionable and impactful is the advice for someone’s financial life?
  * High Usefulness: Advice that can lead to significant financial changes (e.g., specific investment strategies, tax-saving techniques).
  * Low Usefulness: General advice or motivational tips (e.g., “Start saving early,” “Avoid debt”).
- Complexity: How complex is the advice in terms of execution?
  * High Complexity: Requires in-depth understanding or effort to implement (e.g., creating a diversified investment portfolio, setting up a trust).
  * Low Complexity: Simple, well-known tips (e.g., “Reduce discretionary spending,” “Create a budget”).
- Uniqueness: Is the advice widely available/common knowledge, or is it something relatively new or not often discussed?
  * Unique: Strategies not commonly discussed or niche topics (e.g., advanced tax strategies, using balance transfer cards for debt).
  * Common: Basic financial principles that most people know (e.g., “Compound interest is powerful,” “Start investing early”).

## Score Assignment:

• Usefulness: 1 = Not useful, 5 = Highly useful.
• Complexity: 1 = Very simple, 5 = Highly complex.
• Uniqueness: 1 = Common knowledge, 5 = Rare or unique insight.
